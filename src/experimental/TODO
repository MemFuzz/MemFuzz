support generating template for c++

array shuffle for basic types.

Bit field in C/C++                # Detected. We need to use macro to mutate bit fields as they can not be passed by pointers. I think probably we do not need to mutate them as there are not critical cases.

AFL seems buggy in this version? Pipe problems?

rename the in-class anonymous struct

Automate the incomplete structure replacement.

Prioritize types need less time.

For pointer types, we need always check if the address is valid. We do not implement for basic types but it works okay. Do we need to add them?

Union handling problem. If we mutate an address and add it to the dup, we can not mutate it again. We need special case to handle it.
