Pahole version 1.21
Both gen_struct and pahole directory are the modified version of pahole-1.21

1. gen_struct generates memfuzz_enum.h, memfuzz_enum1.h. We also use it to generate /tmp/class.h, which includes all struct definitions
2. pahole is the modified code that print only class name, class member name and its type information. It prints the information to stdout but we redirect it to class_info.
3. original is the src of pahole 1.21

We first use pahole to generate class_info, and use python codes to parse the information and copy the corresponding structs generated from gen_struct to make new file header.

Valgrind version 3.21.0
1. valgrind-3.21.0 is the modified valgrind code. We use it to dump call sequence. The call sequence is then processed by analyze.py
