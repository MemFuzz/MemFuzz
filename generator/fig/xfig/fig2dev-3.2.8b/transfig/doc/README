PLEASE NOTE:  This guide is hopelessly out of date.

This directory contains a manual which describes TransFig and how to use it.
The manual includes TransFig figures, which have been translated into
LaTeX picture environment commands.  To re-generate the manual, run
fig2dev -L latex trans.fig trans.tex
