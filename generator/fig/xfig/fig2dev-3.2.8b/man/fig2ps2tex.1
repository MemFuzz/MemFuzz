.SH NAME
fig2ps2tex - generate a TeX file for including a PostScript file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fig2ps2tex
.I file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Fig2ps2tex
generates a TeX file for including a PostScript file in a TeX document.
This involves calculating the bounding box from the Postscript document.
The TeX inclusion file is written to stdout.
.PP
There is also
.I Fig2ps2tex.csh
for those systems with csh and dc.
.PP
Note that the
.I psfig
macro package provides a more sophisticated approach to including
Postscript files in LaTeX documents.
.I Fig2ps2tex
works with plain TeX however.

.SH USAGE
.PP
Assume the Postscript file is called
.I foo.ps .
The command

.RS
% fig2ps2tex foo.ps >foo.tex
.RE

will create the inclusion file with bounding information.
Then include this file in your TeX document with the command

.RS
\einput{foo}
.RE
