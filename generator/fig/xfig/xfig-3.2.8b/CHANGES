	  of mouse wheel, or horizontal movement on touchpad).

CHANGES:
	o Rename the text flag "Special Flag" to "TeX Flag".
	o Interpolated splines are now created with the recommended value of the

	o Draw lines with the same width on screen as in PostScript and other
	  outputs.

BUGS FIXED:
	o Add compile-switch --enable-tablet for using an input tablet.
	o Eventually, sorted out the xpm switches. Only use --enable-xpm-splash.

NEW FEATURES:
	o Should compile on Mac (Darwin) after installing dependencies using
	  Macports, Fink or Homebrew.
	o Add two rudimentary tests. Run with make check.

UI CHANGES:
	From Brian V. Smith. These changes were made because the original
	view was of the drawing on the page instead of the modern view
	of the observer moving left/right/up/down:

	o Left arrow moves observer left (used to scroll canvas left)
	o Right arrow moves observer right

	  importing PNG images with palettes
	o Other updates for PNG library version 1.5 from Peter Volkov
	o Some versions of Cygwin don't have either REG_NOERROR or REG_OKAY defined so
	  REG_NOERROR defined to be 0
	o Changed X-Spline parameter to match original intent of X-Spline authors:
	  changed definition of Q(s) from -s to -0.5 * s in u_draw_spline.c
	o Allowance for stricter ghostscript in -dSAFER mode.  Was causing error on reading EPS images.
	  From Hans de Goede
	o Security vulnerability with importing images fixed
	  (RedHat bug # 657981 - xfig buffer overflow when opening .fig file with malicius color definition)
	o When exporting to combined PS/PDF/LATEX the -D option to exclude all but active layers

	o Renamed O_TEXT to O_TXT to avoid conflicts with system define
	o On lines with Round or Projecting cap style and arrowheads, the line endpoint stuck out
	  beyond the arrowhead

	From Vladsilav Zavjalov:
	o Uses fontsets for all fonts in international mode
	o SEGV when zooming while creating object (e.g. text)
	o Add locale_encoding appres which acts similar to euc_encoding, but uses system locale and
	  mbrlen function for multibyte character length calculation.
	o Move "file not found" error message from check_docfile() to launch_viewer(),
	  remove excess check_docfile() call.
	  Error message is not shown when looking for a locale-dependent docs. It is shown only
	  if no docs found at all.
	o Do not do strcpy with equal arguments in w_cmdpanel.c/update_cur_filename()
	o Print to file had extra argument in sprintf in international mode
	o Message panel not tall enough with 3D Athena widgets

NEW FEATURES:
	o "Chop" tool which allows you to chop polylines, arcs and circles into individual objects that together,
	  approximate the original object.
	  From Chris Moller
	o Fig-color merged into Fig app-defaults file because almost no one knows about
	  the "*customization: -color" option to make X programs read the color def file.
	o 22 new arrowhead types
	o changed default browser to firefox and default pdf viewer to xpdf
	o HTML MAP export (fig2dev) produces reference to .png file instead of .gif now

BUGS FIXED:
	o dimension line arrowhead width and length used %d instead of %f in
	  dialog, always displaying 0
	o leftover debugging printf(...color = ) in startup
	o finally fixed size of mode panel so it doesn't cover indicator panel
	  under certain circumstances

	o w_keyboard.c had pointer assignment reversed
	o extraneous "done" in Imakefile in "install.jhtml" section
	  From Eric Scott
	o many protoytpe cleanups from Eric Scott
	o #ifndef __FreeBSD__ added around #include <alloca.h> from Eric Scott
	o uses rint() instead of lrint() for those with non-C99 compilers
	o Solaris doesn't have REG_NOERROR for regex, so have new #define for that
	o added dependency on version.h and patchlevel.h for f_util.c and f_save.c to
	  Imakefile
	o In imperial fractional scale mode, if the user scale factor wasn't 1.0, xfig

	  PostScript and PDF that included LaTeX-only (special) text
	o Bug when doing Save As to a shorter filename - would corrupt name sometimes
	o Note about 450 pixels/cm didn't make it from the FORMAT3.1 file to FORMAT3.2

-----------------------------------
Patchlevel 5 (Feb 22, 2007):

NEW FEATURES:
	o Shift-U accelerator added to popup units panel
	o The library menu button sizes with the library panel, to show longer
	  path names if the user wants.
	o The cursor for drawing lines, splines, etc. is a crosshair now instead
	  of an arrow.
	o Snap features to allow snapping points to endpoints, midpoints and
	  intersections of other objects.
	  From Chris Moller.
	o Keyboard input of object coordinates for precise positioning.
	  From Chris Moller.
	o Can grab arc anywhere along the curve instead of just at grab points
	  From Chris Moller.
	o Added -noflipvisualhints for cases where, due to "different" pointer
	  devices, they aren't really flipped, but the mapping indicates they are.
	o Export to all of PS, PDF and LaTeX in one operation
	  From Alistair Ramsey
	o Reorganized Networks library and new devices: ASX-200, 1000, and 4000
	  by Bill Chimiak
	o New figures "betty.fig" (Betty Boop) and "nikke.fig" (German detective
	  Nick Knatter) in Libraries/Examples drawn by Markku Reunanen
	o Can finish text input by pressing Escape.  This removes the cancellation
	  of a compose sequence (e.g. a-umlaut)
	o Actually a bug fix, import of PDF files is now possible.  The code was
	  there since version 3.2.3, but the user interface was not.
	o Nearly-full ANSI protoization of code by Harald Koenig
	o Installation of Libraries and doc files faster with tar instead of shell loop
	o New Gregorian chant music symbols from Bill Chimiak.  Also, Music library
	  divided into "chant" and "modern"
	o Popup edit panel slightly more compact vertically
	o New library "Fasteners" containing various bolts and screws
	  From Jim Yuzwalk
	o Increased size of numeric entry fields in indicator panels
	o N-channel IGBT in Electronic/Schematics Library from Art Blair
	o starting values for arrow type, width, length, thickness may be specified
	  on command-line or in X resources:
	  -startarrowtype, -startarrowwidth, -startarrowlength, -startarrowthick

BUGS FIXED:
	o xfig would crash on 64-bit processors because of a missing include, which
	  causes new_string() to be declared implicitly as returning an integer.
	  This may cause the top 32 bits to get lost and hence the crash.
	o Blanks not preserved in imported picture filename when reading Fig file
	o When in metric mode, decimal precision was ignored for dimension lines
	o When showing vertex numbers on objects, first vertex is now 0 to match
	  edit window vertex numbers
	o Also, vertex numbers are not shown on inactive (grayed) layers
	o Widget shadow resources moved from Fig-color to Fig because they don't
	  really have anything to do with color. There was a problem when running
	  KDE because it set a global resource *Scrollbar*height: which made xfig
	  freeze when *customization: -color was NOT used.
	o The point positioning indicator is turned on when editing a compound
	  object to show the user that it is used
	o Increased the maximum size of images that can be imported.  There was
	  a limit in the PostScript image encoder of 4096x4096 pixels.  This was
	  increased to 8192x8192.
	o Centered text was changed to left-justified when flipped horizontally
	  inside a compound object.
	o With -v option, after reporting the version, xfig would say that -v
	  was an unknown option
	o Local locale was being used when writing the xfig cut buffer file
	  instead of switching to "C" locale.  This created commas instead of
	  decimal (.) for numbers in those particular locales.
	  From Dirk Osswald
	o Local locale was used when forming command for calling fig2dev,
	  resulting in commas instead of decimals for floating point numbers.
	o count_user_colors buffer overflow fixed
	o Under Cygwin, temporary file stayed around after unlink(), causing
	  error when importing more than one ps/eps/pdf file
	o Segfault when using -update because appres resources were NULL
	o -update option failed when not first option passed to xfig
	o Clicking window manager "close window" button in library titlebar
	  didn't close the window
	o Wasn't distributing objects in compounds when there were only 2 objects
	o Some compilers complain about the order of declaration in u_fonts.h - fixed
	o Northern part of map of India was incorrect (Libraries/Maps/Asia/india.fig)
	o Map of Serbia was misnamed "yugoslavia.fig" (Libraries/Maps/Europe/yugoslavia.fig)
	o Map of Central Europe had old Yugoslavia instead of Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia-
	  Herzegovina, and Macedonia (also, Slovenia was mistakenly inside the border)
	o Editing a compound object with more than 200 texts would crash xfig

-----------------------------------
Patchlevel 5-alpha5 (April, 26, 2004):

NEW FEATURES:
	o Added note to README and FAQ html file:
	  If the Xaw or Xaw3d Athena widget sets are compiled with the
	  ARROW_SCROLLBAR style of scrollbars, there is no StartScroll action
	  and you won't be able to scroll using the wheel on the mouse.
	  If you want to be able to scroll using the wheel, you must recompile
	  the Xaw library from sources, disabling the ARROW_SCROLLBAR option.
	o Astrological symbols for planets in Miscellaneous/Astrology by Andrew Collier
	o Added key bindings to text dialogs to be more like modern systems (the
	  Athena Widget Set that xfig uses is very old):
	    Home:  beginning-of-line
	    End:   end-of-line
	    Del:   delete-character-right
	o Added *.jpeg* to picture browse options
	o New libraries for electronics from Fabio González in
	  Libraries/Electronics/Schematic/More

BUGS FIXED:
	o typo in latex_and_xfig.html and LATEX_AND_XFIG files. Text should be:
	  \convertMPtoPDF{foo.0}{1}{1}
	  It was missing parameters {1}{1}
	o -correct_font_size missing from -help option list and man pages
	o -help and -version didn't work unless they were first in the options
	o -O option wasn't passed to fig2dev for overlapping pages in multiple
	  page mode for PostScript export
-----------------------------------
Patchlevel 5-alpha4 (Feb, 19, 2004):

Note:	There is a minor change to the copyright/permission notice for xfig.
	Basically, I have restored the part that allows one to sell xfig
	regardless of whether it is bundled as part of a package or not.
	This is identical to the original copyright/permission notice for
	xfig, which was based on the MIT (then later, the X Consortium)
	copyright notice.
	Here is the new notice (different files have different author
	copyrights at the top):

BUGS FIXED:
	o When loading a library object, if it contained only a compound and
	  nothing else, when xfig promoted that compound to the toplevel the
	  main comment was lost
	o Incorrect header files used for SmeBSB resulted in either segfault or
	  none of the command panel entries being underlined
	o Drawing very large splines (e.g. at zoom = 0.01) caused integer
	  roundoff errors, making xfig loop indefinitely
	o Bug where a line that had a zero width or length arrowhead was not
	  redrawn after being moved, copied, canvas redraw, etc.
	o The page border and axis lines would obscure Fig objects when moving,
	  copying etc. other objects on the canvas.
	o In the popup picture editor, if the relative position of the corners
	  of the picture were changed, the rotation field was not updated
	  (this bug was in 3.2.5-alpha3 only)
	o line, arc, ellipse length tool was reporting 0 length

-----------------------------------
Patchlevel 5-alpha3 (Dec, 9, 2003):

NOTE:
	o URL for information about the color optimization code (written by
	  Anthony Dekker) has changed to:
	  http://members.ozemail.com.au/~dekker/NEUQUANT.HTML

NEW FEATURES:
	o -autorefresh command-line option (resource: Fig.autorefresh) which
	  will make xfig look at the timestamp on the .fig file and
	  automatically load it and display it every time it changes.
	o Removed requirement to compile with WHEELMOUSE when using wheelmouse
	o New tower computers (Libraries/Computers/AOpenKF45E.fig and
	  AOpenKF45E.fig from Dirko van Schalkwyk)
	o New 10/100 8port hub (Libraries/Networks/3Com3C16750.fig also from
	  Dirko van Schalkwyk)
	o When placing library objects, the name and comments are displayed in
	  message window
	o New flags (Libraries/Flags): Africa/Eritrea, Africa/Zimbabwe,
	  Asia/Myanmar, Asia/Tajikstan, Asia/Kyrgystan, Europe/Croatia
	o non-polar capacitor added to Libraries/Electronic/Schematic
	o Mouse wheel can be used to scroll through filename lists in File and
	  Export panels and icons or object lists in Library panel
	o Thickness of ticks in dimension lines are user-adjustable now
	o For attribute popup dialogs with only one text entry, keyboard now
	  focuses on the entry as long as the pointer is anywhere in the dialog
	o When using the "Open compound, keep rest visible", the other objects
	  are drawn in shades of gray similar to the inactive layers feature.
	o New library objects: adder, multiplier, sine-source and voltage-source
	  in Electronic/Schematic by Hubert Lam
	o Zooming in or out with the Z or z key respectively will keep the canvas
	  centered on the mouse pointer
	o Full version and patchlevel is included in Fig file header for
	  diagnostics
	o Can explicitly set the rotation of imported pictures in edit panel
	  after importing
	o Export option to produce both EPS and PDF (in two files) in one step.
	  Useful for those who both use LaTeX and PDFLaTeX
	o "Epoch" added to rpm spec
	o New HP/GL2 (fig2dev) driver from Glenn Burkhardt with paper size
	  selection, offset, centering and orientation options
	o New library object "atom" in Libraries/Miscellaneous is the classic
	  drawing of an atom with electrons circling
	  From Andrew B. Collier

BUGS FIXED:
	o Missing #ifdef XAW3D in SimpleMenu.c
	o Bug when breaking a compound object - depths were added twice to the
	  counts
	o When implicitly cancelling the placement of a library object by
	  choosing another mode, xfig would do one of two things:
	    1. tell user to cancel or finish the current operation, but there
	       was no way to do that
	    2. create the object that was being cancelled with extremely large,
	       negative coordinates
	o Picture Reread button was active before file was read the first time
	o Rereading picture in edit popup produced bad colors
	o When using multiple copies of an imported picture, h/w ratio was not
	  computed for copies
	o Importing PCX images were incorrect when bytes per line different from
	  width*bpp
	o When passed a filename containing a directory name for a Fig object
	  library using -library_dir, and that directory only contains Fig files
	  and no subdirectories with Fig files, xfig segfaulted
	o Several checks for memory allocation failure added to the library
	  loading procs
	o Forgot to free allocated memory when return abnormally from loading
	  libraries
	o Path length check in loading libraries fixed
	o Missing include for put_msg prototype in e_measeure.c
	o Needed #ifdef for XtVersion in SmeBSB.c (X11R5 doesn't have
	  international fontset)
	o Added SIGPIPE signal to ignore in case an external program dies when we're
	  using pipes
	o Screen capture on an MSBFirst X server with 24/32 bits per pixel was
	  incorrect.
	o Importing any image file on such a server was incorrect (bytes/bits
	  reversed).
	o Reading GIF or PCX files on 24-bit server *and* on big-endian machine
	  (e.g. Sparcstation) resulted in bytes being swapped and funny colors
	o Could popup unit dialog when drawing/editing objects
	o Embedded whitespace in filenames in recently loaded files weren't
	  parsed properly (.xfigrc)
	o When pasting an object on the canvas, point positioning grid wasn't used
	o Bug when reading a compressed eps file (file handle was passed to open
	  proc instead of name)
	o Minor grid spec used twice instead of minor/major when passed to fig2dev
	o Fixed conversions of export/print grid values when switching to/from
	  metric, decimal or fraction
	o When loading or merging a file, xfig appended ".fig" to the name if
	  there wasn't ".fig" in the name. Now it only appends ".fig" if there
	  is no suffix (no ".").
	o When appending the ".fig" before the previous change, xfig would segfault
	o Libraries/Electronic/Schematic/transformer and transformer_ironcore
	  aligned to 1/16" grid
	o Bugs in indicator panel display of text flags, dimension line params
	  and arrow size params when cycling through settings with middle or
	  right mouse button
	o Bug in callbacks for dimension line checkboxes that select actual
	  length or user text
	o When exporting to Combined PDF/LaTeX it uses ".pdf" and ".pdf_t"
	  suffixes because LaTeX doesn't recognize ".pdftex" as a PDF file
	o Better clipping around arrowheads on thick lines (lines that are
	  thicker than the arrowhead is wide)
	o Checks for open splines of < 2 points when reading figure file and
	  removes them
	o Clicking middle mouse button after creating first point of closed
	  spline switched to freehand mode
	o Export panel sections would get messed up when changing export
	  languages
	o Now checks whether scrollbars support StartScroll before trying to use
	  it for the wheel scrolling.  When the Xaw widgets are compiled with
	  ARROW_SCROLLBAR, there is no such action.
	o pstex_t export lacked border option (-b) to align LaTeX text when
	  pstex figure specified border (also fixed in fig2dev)
	o Create one picture object with no filename, then create another and
	  xfig crashed
	o Some bugs when freeing dimension line components
	o Bad choices for grid dot spacing in metric mode in the 5mm grid, and
	  decimal inch mode in the 0.5 and 1.0 inch grids
	o -international flag missing from xfig.html and xfig.man docs
	o Added call to XsetLocaleModifiers() when initializing input method
	  (-international mode only)
	o xfig was limiting arrowhead lengths to 50 pixels instead of 50 inches,
	  and the width to 10 pixels instead of 10 inches.
	o edit panel for circles shouldn't have "angle" entry
	o edit panel wasn't allowing typing in of negative angles for text and
	  ellipses
	o Objects were sometimes drawn with a wild point when zooming
	o Full path was being added to default export filename and wasn't
	  changing when user changed directories
	o When drawing a box or rounded box with the "show line lengths" on, the
	  sizes were in Fig units (1200ppi) instead of user units.
	o Spacing cedilla (ISO 0xB8 / octal 270) was missing from CompKeyDB file
	o Changing the units in the popup edit panel for a text object caused a
	  segfault.
	o Rulers and grid didn't change scale when user scale was != 1.0.  Even
	  though the message window showed the correct user scale when drawing
	  objects, the rulers and grid still showed the unscaled values.
	o Axis lines through 0,0 now drawn after page border so it remains
	  visible when there is a grid
	o Segfault if current directory was deleted after starting xfig
	o Positioning grid was set to "ANY" when editing a compound object,
	  causing the original bounding box to be lost
	o Bug in arc drawing caused arcs to be drawn as circles at high zoom
	o Computing the area of a polygon larger than 38x38 inches overflowed
	  calculation
	o Bug in bounds calculation for ellipses and circles that increased
	  bounding box even with line width = 1
	o Limit on number of styles in a family wasn't checked
	o If all depths were turned off and any edit operation was attempted on
	  the canvas such as move object, delete object, xfig would hang,
	  searching for objects indefinitely.

----------------------------
Patchlevel 4 (December 2002)

SPECIAL COPYRIGHT NOTICE:

*********** THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED BY THE ONE FOR 3.2.5 ***********
The xfig copyright has changed slightly since the previous version.
It now states that:

	Any party obtaining a copy of these files is granted, free of charge, a
	full and unrestricted irrevocable, world-wide, paid up, royalty-free,
	nonexclusive right and license to deal in this software and
	documentation files (the "Software"), including without limitation the
	rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish and/or distribute copies of
	the Software, and to permit persons who receive copies from any such
	party to do so, with the only requirement being that this copyright
	notice remain intact.

The previous notice allowed the *selling* of xfig or any code in xfig. This is
not allowed now, unless xfig is simply included in a collection of programs
(e.g. on a CD) that you are selling.
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES:

	o Binary RPM available for systems with rpm (RedHat Package Manager).
	o Examples moved to Libraries/Examples so they are installed in a
	  convenient place for viewing (via the library feature)
	o "Front" and "Back" labels in depth manager to show relative
	  positioning of depths on drawing.
	o The mu (micro) character is now entered using "Compose | u" instead
	  of "Compose / u"
	o If you wish to place a library object at the position it was
	  originally created, e.g. for laser printer labels, hold down the Shift
	  key and press mouse button 3 (`place at orign posn') to place it.
	o New URL for chemtool, a chemical structure editor:
	  http://ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de/~martin/chemtool/chemtool.html
	o The minimum and maximum depth of objects are shown in the edit panel
	  for compound objects
	o EMF (Enhanced Metafile) export driver (TransFig/fig2dev) based on CGM
	  driver. Converted by M. Schrick
	o SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) beta driver (for TransFig/fig2dev) from
	  Anthony Starks with major improvements by Martin Kroeker
	  Some caveats when using Mozilla-SVG to view these:
	    1. the file must be exported with magnification = 6.6% (0.066 in
	       fig2dev) to scale to screen coords
	    2. the file suffix must be ".xml"
	o The xfig documentation is nearly entirely GIF-free (TM).  Only the
	  frames images use GIF because they use a transparent background, which
	  many browsers don't honor.  PNG is used for all other images.
	o Xfig reference manual now available in PDF besides html.  The English
	  version is in Doc/xfig_en.pdf and the Japanese in Doc/xfig_jp.pdf.
	  These are also available in the Help menu.
	o Dimension lines - Hold the shift key down while drawing a polyline,
	  and after specifying the two endpoints a "dimension line" is created,
	  which is actually a compound object containing the line drawn (with
	  arrowheads if auto arrow mode is on) in the current color, "tick"
	  lines at each endpoint, text showing the length of the line in the
	  current units, and a box around the text filled in the current fill
	  color.  If this compound object is rescaled or one or more endpoints
	  are moved, the actual length is recalculated and the text is updated.
	o New Xfig logo courtesy of Marc-Aurele Darche.
	o Can now paste text in text mode using Shift+Middle-mouse-button in
	  addition to F20 and Sun's Paste key (F18).
	o If xfig is compiled with #define WHEELMOUSE uncommented in the
	  Imakefile, the wheel may be used for several things (see html docs
	  under Miscellaneous/Wheel Mouse).
	o New grid/positioning option for inches mode: -grid_unit.  If the value
	  given is "1/10", "ten", "tenth", "1/10" or "10", (e.g. -grid_unit ten)
	  then the grid and point positioning is in decimal inches.  Otherwise
	  they are in 1/16 inch units (as before).  When in this mode, the grid
	  step sizes are 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 inch and the positioning steps are
	  0.05, 0.10, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 inch.
	o Background (-g to fig2dev) option for tk export honored now.
	o New command-line argument -correct_font_size (X resource
	  Fig.correct_font_size) to make xfig use real points for font sizes
	  instead of units of 1/80 inch.  xfig has always claimed that the font
	  size units are points (1/72inch), but in fact they were 1/80 inch.
	  This new option is not the default because it will break some figures
	  by making the text too large compared to other Fig objects, but it
	  will be the default in a future version.
	  The corresponding argument to fig2dev is -F (xfig automatically sets
	  this when calling fig2dev).
	o Added "Stop" button to stop loading library.
	o Much more efficient when copying large imported pictures - existing
	  pixmap is used instead of creating new one.  This also precludes the
	  need to remap colors when running out of colors when the colors are
	  identical.
	o When changing an attribute of an imported picture that doesn't change
	  the picture itself (e.g. depth), the pixmap is not regenerated,
	  therefore saving time.  The same is true when copying a picture.
	o New X resource Fig.ghostscript and command-line argument -ghostscript
	  by which you can tell xfig what your ghostscript is called (e.g. "gs"
	  or "gswin32").
	o Can now add ASCII (EPSI) preview to EPS export. See export panel.
	o Can now add monochrome or color TIFF preview to EPS export.  This is
	  needed by Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, etc. to display the EPS on the
	  screen. Select from the pulldown menu of export languages.  You must
	  have fig2dev 3.2.4 for these features. See export panel.
	o Translations of LATEX.AND.XFIG document into two popular Chinese
	  encodings (GB2312 and Big5).  These are called LATEX.AND.XFIG.zh_CN
	  and LATEX.AND.XFIG.zh_TW respectively.
	  From Mendel Chan
	o When text becomes too small to see (e.g. small zoom), xfig will
	  "Greek" it, meaning it draws a gray line segment for each word in the
	  string.
	o When resizing canvas to a smaller height, the number of buttons per
	  row of the mode (side) panel increases so that it doesn't protrude
	  into the indicator (bottom) panel
	o Smarter redraw when turning on depths from the depth manager.  If
	  depth N is turned on and there are no active depths < N, only depth N
	  is drawn - otherwise, the canvas is erased and the whole figure is
	  redrawn.
	o If the user's pointer (mouse) buttons are switched (usually 3 2 1)
	  xfig will automatically flip the mouse hints messages. This overrides
	  the -flipvisualhints command-line argument.
	o If the user clicks on or modifies an existing text, and presses
	  return, the new text on the next line will use the attributes of the
	  first text instead of the attributes from the indicator panel.
	o Note in README and Imakefile about not casually setting the DESTDIR
	  make variable.
	o Picture objects are drawn as filled gray boxes when their layer is
	  inactive in gray mode.
	o xfig no longer requires fonts that are named "-adobe-..." (e.g. for
	  RedHat systems with URW fonts).
	o Updating the attribute panel from a compound object will retrieve
	  (only) the smallest depth from the compound.
	o When scaling an object, the line thickness is no longer scaled with it
	o New measuring modes: angle, length, area and tangent. See Editing
	  section in html docs.  From Alex Durner.
	o New feature to add tangents and normal lines to curves.  See Editing
	  section in html docs.  From Alex Durner.
	o Splash screen on startup. Disable with -nosplash (resource Fig.splash).
	  Interior logo by  Marc-Aurèle Darche.
	o New command-line option -grid_color (resource grid_color) to set the
	  color of the canvas grid (default: red).
	o New option to print grid when exporting or printing (see printing/
	  exporting section in html docs).
	o When drawing an arc by specifying the center point, a circle is drawn
	  showing the radius of the arc as the user drags the mouse, then when
	  the first end point is clicked an arc is drawn as the mouse is dragged.
	  The user then clicks in the direction the arc should go, followed by
	  the final angle to complete it.
	o If the Ruler unit is Imperial (in), you may have xfig display
	  measurements using fractions where possible.  If a measurement can be
	  shown as an integer multiple of 64ths of an inch (or 32nds, 16ths,
	  etc.) it will show it as such (e.g. 3-5/64 in), otherwise a decimal
	  value will be shown (e.g. 3.085 in).
	o When opening a compound object, if the middle button us used to open
	  the compound, all other objects on the canvas are kept visible.
	  From Alex Durner.
	o When opening a compound object, the "point positioning" indicator is
	  enabled, allowing you to set the bounds of the compound according to
	  the indicator when you close the compound.
	o Zero-crossing lines on canvas have own command-line parameter
	  (-zero_lines) and resource (Fig.zero_lines) for setting color separate
	  from page border color.
	o Smooth factor when exporting to bitmap format is now a pull-down menu
	  with: No smoothing, Some smoothing, More smoothing.
	o When flipping compound objects with text, a vertical flip will now
	  shift the text to maintain its relative position to the other objects
	  in the compound and its angle is rotated by 180 degrees minus the
	  original angle.  This behavior will for example, keep the orientation
	  of a text inside a polygon consistent with the polygon.
	  A horizontal flip of a compound containing text will change the angle
	  in the same way.
	o Three-D borders for buttons, etc reduced from 2 to 1 pixel for "lean"
	  look (resource Fig*shadowWidth in Fig-color.ad).
	o Additional JPEG file format (EXIF) added for import. These usually
	  come from digital cameras.
	o Validation for integer spinners - doesn't allow non-numeric input when
	  typing in values directly.
	o When scaling an object, the scale factor is shown in the message.
	  window in addition to the width/height. From Alex Durner.
	o New url for pstoedit (mentioned in installation.html).
	o When picking points of an object at high zoom, the tolerance has been
	  reduced to make it easier to pick the correct point.
	o When "graying" inactive depths, the inactive objects are drawn first
	  followed by active objects ensuring visibility of active objects.
	o xfig now draws "grayed out" picture objects (inactive depth) as a gray
	  box with the filename only.
	o Line style in edit panel now shows graphic of style instead of
	  textual description.
	o Cap style in edit panel was inadvertantly left off open-splines.
	o Popup dialog to edit behavior of spline point now pops up near the
	  point being edited.
	o When cancelling drawing a picture object from the popup editor, the
	  empty object is removed rather than showing a <empty> in the box.
	o Pressing Return or Escape in popup message window will dismiss it.
	o In picture browser popup, double clicking or clicking and pressing
	  Return will apply the selected picture AND close the browser.
	o New popup query if updating the depth in a compound object would
	  result in any depth exceeding the maximum.  The popup gives the user
	  the option to cancel the depth update part.
	  From Marcus Eger
	o More consistent placement of Cancel/Ok/Set etc. buttons in dialogs.
	  Generally, the Cancel button is first followed by the others, and
	  where possible, they are at the bottom of the dialog.
	o More meaningful message "Cut buffer is empty" if there is no .xfig
	  file in the user's home directory.
	o New MetaPost driver for TransFig 3.2.4 supported.
	o New option for binary CGM export (must have TransFig 3.2.4 too). The
	  ralcgm program is required for this option.
	  See ftp://ftp.cc.rl.ac.uk/pub/graphics/ralcgm/
	o In popup edit panel for compound objects, one may easily shift a
	  compound object by changing either corner's x, y values and pressing
	  return or scale it by changing the width and/or height and pressing
	  return.
	o "condensed" alias for "narrow" fonts (urw changed their helvetica-
	   narrow to helvetica-condensed).
	o Pressing escape in a popup dialog will dismiss it.
	o Zoom/Unzoom (Shift-Z/z) changes zoom by a factor of 1.5 instead of
	  adding or subtracting 1 from the zoom value. Also, the zoom/unzoom is
	  centered on the canvas.
	o Exporting to JPEG doesn't require compiling with USE_JPEG defined in
	  Imakefile.
	o Minimum and maximum depths of objects in a compound are displayed in
	  popup edit panel.
	o Named styles where user can save attributes that are often used for
	  quick access.  For example, the user may want dashed, thick, red lines
	  often so he can save those attributes and call it (e.g.) "thickred",
	  and easily call it up later.  See the html docs in Main Menus (the
	  View/Manage Styles...) menu entry.

NEW LIBRARIES and Examples:

	o Poster advertizing German version of "Little Shop of Horrors" in
	  Libraries/Examples/poster.fig.  From Kai-Martin Knaak
	o Three new Examples from Carlo Kopp (in Libraries/Examples):
	   Python-4.fig  - RAFAEL Python 4 all aspect agile heatseeking missile
	   YF-23A.fig    - Development example of the USAF's Northrop-MDC YF-23A
	   tsr2-side.fig - Notional camouflages for BAC TSR.2 production aircraft.
	o Many new country flags in the Libraries/Flags directory. Now
	  organized by region of the world (e.g. Africa, Europe, MiddleEast).
	o New flags of Bosnia and Slovenia with vector coat of arms in
	  Libraries/Flags directory from Roman Maurer
	o New maps of Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and
	  Slovenia (Libraries/Maps/Europe)
	o New maps of Russia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan
	  and Uzbekistan (Libraries/Maps/Asia)
	o New Avery label templates in Libraries/Labels directory, including a
	  CD label, Avery_5931, done by William Chimiak.
	o New Avery and PerfectData Corp CD label templates in Libraries/Labels
	  directory, done by Len Hickey.
	o New computers and printers in Libraries/Computers library from Ernst
	  Pisch
	o New network library devices Extreme Networks Inc. Black Diamond and
	  Summit 5i network switches, Net Gear Hub, and new CODECs in
	  Audiovisual library from Bill Chimiak
	o New DSP component library from Jakub Stastny
	o Standard welding bevels library from Erik Engh (Libraries/Welding)
	o Canadian map from Seymour Green
	o A Uno hand (card game) drawn by Roland Rosendfeld
	  (Libraries/Examples/uno_hand.fig)

BUGS FIXED:

	o Undo of join/split now works correctly.
	  From Pieter-Tjerk de Boer
	o Pulldown menu for object library didn't always go away while loading
	  library
	o If -library_dir was relative path, any imported pictures in library
	  files wouldn't be found.
	o If in text draw mode and user uses Alt- accelerator, the compose LED
	  would stay on
	o Middle mouse emulation for 2-button mice wasn't accepting Alt-Right-
	  click, only Meta-Right-click.
	o If one created a new figure and didn't save it before exporting, the
	  export command was malformed resulting in an error message.
	o Numeric locale setting moved to routines that read and write Fig files
	  so that the user's numeric convention is used in everything else.
	o Point positioning was truncated in the negative X and Y regions of the
	  canvas instead of being rounded.
	o -b (border margin) wasn't being passed to fig2dev for PDF and PSTEX
	  output.
	o xfig only recalculate the bounds of compound objects being read if
	  there are no bounds following the "6" or they are all 0.  This fixes
	  the problem introduced in 3.2.3d where objects that were bound at a
	  certain point positioning were rebound at the current positioning.
	o When xfig reads in a .fig file (merge_file or load_lib_obj) it will
	  not put the file into another compound if it contains only one
	  compound. This will prevent the double compounding of library objects
	  or merged files.
	o If a compound with more than 64 strings was edited, xfig segfaulted
	  because the limit wasn't checked.  This is fixed, and the limit has
	  been increased to 200.
	o Typo in figx.h. "#ifdef XAW3d" instead of "#ifdef XAW3D" (capital "D")
	o If the XFIGDOCDIR directory didn't already exist, install.doc failed.
	o The "make install.all" directive did not install the executable, as
	  the README file said is would.  This has been fixed.
	o Deleting a region (middle mouse button delete) of a figure resulted in
	  all other objects dissappearing after a screen refresh.
	o If the user mistakenly clicked the *left* mouse button on a point
	  where he wanted to *split* a line, the ability to split was turned off.
	o Toplevel library directory wasn't included in library menu when it
	  contained .fig files.
	o Subdirectories without any .fig files appeared in the library menus,
	  contrary to the documentation.
	o If xfig was renamed to anything else, the command-line arguments and
	  X resources weren't parsed by the Intrinsics.  This is fixed.
	o Some versions of "make" don't like the blank line produced by the
	  "#ifdef I18N" in the install.html section of the Imakefile, so it has
	  been reworked to get around that bug.
	o Array placement with horizontally/vertically constrained copy works now
	o Html "options" page showed "-pa" as abbreviation for -paper_size, when
	  in fact it is now "-pap" because of the new "-pageborder" option.
	o If display zoom was large (> 20) and grid was turned on, very large
	  pixmap was being created for the grid.
	o Inconsistancy with "char" vs "unsigned char" in get_canvas_clipboard().
	o Text input and editing more efficient when redrawing large fonts.
	o Box curve indicator now appears when in "convert box<->arcbox" mode.
	o If user called xfig with empty (but existing) file, the filename was
	  not retained for subsequent save.
	o Cleaned up redrawing of corner markers when editing objects from popup
	  edit panel.
	o Scaling arcbox didn't report scaling messages.
	o When scaling rotated ellipses, scaling messages were overwritten.
	o Improved redraw when moving/scaling/copying objects and screen is
	  redrawn.
	o Drawing units indicator was not updated when reading Fig file.
	o Cleaned up "move point" code.  When moving a corner point of a box or
	  compound or the radius or diameter of a circle or ellipse, it would
	  first make the object dissappear until the mouse was moved.  This
	  doesn't happen anymore.
	o Command-line -userunit (X resource Fig.userunit) were overwritten when
	  reading Fig file.  Now it is only changed if units are inconsistent
	  with value in file.  E.g. if file has "Inches" and xfig has "cm", xfig
	  changes to "in" when reading file.
	o A few files were left open that should be closed.
	o If the print and/or export panels are up and the figure units are
	  changed from/to Metric/Imperial, the figure size wasn't updated in
	  the print/export panel(s).
	o Missing link from editing.html file to "Paste Objects" in
	  main_menus.html.
	o Bug in array place item - didn't work when number of X copies and
	  Y copies = 1.
	o Bug in *undo* of array place - didn't account for adding back object
	  depths
	o (dx, dy) values weren't displayed when moving the midpoints of a line
	  or arc.
	o While drawing freehand (middle mouse button start), if the user wanted
	  to delete points by holding down the shift key and pressing the left
	  button, moving the mouse would still add points to the object
	o PNGINC Imakefile variable added to specify where png.h is located (was
	  already there in fig2dev)
	o The depth counts were erased when deleting a region of a figure.
	o If you choose one object from a library to place on the canvas and
	  then popup the library panel and choose another object, the depths
	  from the temporary object following the pointer weren't accounted for.
	o Added "Fig*AllowShellResize: false" to the app-defaults file to fix a
	  problem that some window managers have with xfig continually resizing
	  itself
	o When saving path of imported picture, xfig thought path was relative
	  to current directory when it wasn't
	o Added "|| defined(apollo)" in fig.h to include sys/types.h
	o Doc/FORMAT3.2 file had imported picture description line reversed with
	  points lines
	o Doc/FORMAT3.2 file had incorrect values for object types in the first
	  part of section 3.
	o Segfault when merging a Fig file with only color objects (no drawing
	  objects)
	o No message when toggling on/off depth manager
	o If xfig couldn't open ~/.xfigrc for writing (e.g. because of
	  permissions) it would segfault
	o Segfault when converting a 2-point line to a polygon.
	  Bugfix from Tom Sato.
	o Segfault when creating a closed spline with three points, where the
	  last two points are coincident.
	  Bugfix from Tom Sato.
	o Typo in attributes.html in describing the selection of the previous or
	  next attribute with mouse buttons 2 and 3 respectively.  For mouse
	  button 2 it should read "previous" and for button 3 "next".
	o Typo in Doc/FORMAT3.2 and Doc/html/fig-format.html for backward_arrow
	  description:
	  said "(0: no forward arrow, 1: on)" instead of ... no backward ...
	o Added $(DUSESMALLICONS) to dependencies for main.c in Imakefile
	o Reduced height of object edit panels by only displaying 3 comment
	  lines and 6 x,y pairs before scrolling.
	o Special texts weren't filtered by the depth filter when exporting to
	  combined ps/latex or pdf/latex
	o Various typographical errors found by Daniel Frèrejacque
	o Segfault if fast export (Alt-Shift-X) is done before either the file,
	  export or browse panel was created
	o When xfig was compiled with WHEELMOUSE support, zooming was always
	  "centered" even not zooming with wheel
	o Typo in Fig.ad resource file for pasting text using F8 key
	o When doing a panic save (segfault, etc.), xfig now closes any open
	  compound objects first
	o Bug in importing GIF file.  File descriptor changed between first open
	  and final close.
	o Bug in Imakefile with JPEGINCDIR
	o Had to include SimpleMenu.c and header files because of changes to
	  some Xaw SimpleMenu implementations that were incompatible with xfig's
	  own SmeBSB object
	o Bug in "Figure size" label in export panel caused segfault sometimes
	o Macro call (up_part) in e_update.c caused problems on HP/UX ANSI
	  compiler
	o Same compiler takes issue with empty action records in w_style.c:
	  library_actions[] ={}; Removed because it isn't used anymore.
	o After pressing the "Reread" button in imported picture edit popup, the
	  Shrink, Expand and Original size buttons were disabled
	o Bug in SmeCascadeP.h when not using 3D widget set (Xaw3d)
	o One remaining use of sys_errlist[] should have been changed to
	  strerror() in f_util.c
	o Pressing Escape while drawing an object caused segfault
	o When line type is dotted and the dot gap is < 0.5, XSetDashes()
	  produced "Bad Value" error.  Found by Tom Sato
	o init_break_tag() and init_break_only() each had an extraneous parameter
	  (loc_tag) which wasn't used and wasn't passed by the caller anyway. This
	  caused havoc with (at least) the gcc optimizer on an Alpha processor.
	  Found by Jay Estabrook.
	o If you open a dimension line compound object and close it with zoom != 1,
	  the text is drawn unzoomed
	o Didn't allow smoothing when exporting to AutoCAD slide file.
	o Changing browser or pdfviewer in dialog had no effect.
	o Fixed problem with RedHat imake rules not installing Doc/xfig.man
	  properly.
	o When making a compound object including lines that have arrowheads and
	  large coordinates (>= 100000), an incorrect bounding box was produced.
	  This same bug was in fig2dev 3.2.3d and earlier.
	o Drawing an arc by starting with the center and dragging it out now
	  reports the angles of the endpoints after clicking on first endpoint
	  instead of incorrectly reporting the radius.
	o Checks that closed splines have at least 3 points when reading Fig
	  file and removes any that have fewer.
	o Exporting with color TIFF preview option missing parameter when
	  calling fig2dev
	o Export grid option disabled for languages other than PS/EPS/PDF/bitmaps
	o Not really a bug, but the message that tells the user when xfig is
	  converting a figure from an older file format to the current format
	  has been removed.
	o When changing the height of xfig, the number of buttons per row on the
	  mode (left) panel increase OR decrease as needed.
	o When reading a Fig file with different units (metric/imperial) than
	  the current figure didn't change the ruler tick spacing.
	o Chemical Process Flowsheet library Valve_horizontal and Valve_vertical
	  valves reversed.
	o Bug in forcing absolute path for picture objects in libraries
	o Bug where xfig may change the Major/Minor printing/export grid tick
	  values from "None" to 0.0
	o When an imported picture is compressed but the .fig file has the
	  uncompressed name, export failed.
	o Xfig allowed "splitting" a picture box into a polyline.  This has been
	  fixed to disallow it.
	o Queries user if hasn't saved named styles after adding or deleting same.
	o Print-to-batch-file didn't call print_to_file with all parms
	o xfig crashed if the window manager deleted the color popup panel in
	  the popup editors


----------------------------
Patchlevel 3d (May 29, 2001)

NEW FEATURES:

	o New Imakefile variable XFIGDOCDIR points to directory for xfig doc
	  files, which may be different from XFIGLIBDIR
	o New aircraft from Carlo Kopp in Examples directory.  These may be
	  reproduced for educational and other non-commercial use only.
	o Support for importing PNG image files added
	o GIF transparency for imported images honored by fig2dev now
	o New option to print only active layers when exporting or printing (see
	  printing/exporting section in html docs).
	o When loading a compressed Fig file that is either read-only, or is on
	  a read-only file system (e.g. a CDROM), xfig uncompresses it into the
	  temp directory (env TMPDIR, or /tmp if TMPDIR environvment variable is
	  undefined).
	o New Maps library - currently contains Most Canadian provinces, USA
	  coast and states, most of the continents and a world outline
	  World outline map and United States by Steve Eichblatt
	o I had forgotten to credit Kai-MartinKnaak for his Mechanical_DIN
	  library of mechanical drawing symbols from July 1998
	o New Chemical Process Flowsheet library by Volker Siepmann
	o New Laptop computer and Ericsson R320 cell phone in Libraries/Computers
	  from Dirko van Schalkwyk
	o New PMOS FET (Field Effect Transistors) and NMOS FET library objects
	  in Electrical/Schematic library - from Min Xu
	o New network devices in Networks library from Bill Chimiak:
		atmswitch.fig	- generic ATM switch
		dsu-csu.fig	- Digital Service Unit/Channel Service Unit
		smartbit.fig	- Netcom Smartbit network tester
	o New Catalan flag in Flags library from Francesc Burrull i Mestres.
	o New office building (office2.fig) in Buildings library from Brian
	  V. Smith
	o New variable PRINTCAP in Imakefile to specify where the printer
	  capabilities file is (default /etc/printcap)
	o New drawing: plan view of house and backyard (Libraries/Examples/house_plans.fig)
	  from Scott Gordon.  It may not be used for profit without express written
	  permission from Scott.
	o xfig recalculates the bounds of compound objects read in from the file,
	  ignoring the bounds values in the file.  This makes it easier for Fig
	  file generators to produce compound objects since they don't have to
	  know how to calculate the bounds themselves. fig2dev doesn't even use
	  those values but recalculates them upon reading the file.
	o New VA Linux machines in Computers library from Yazz Atlas
	o Increased maximum number of libraries to 100
	o New and improved library object Computers/film_digitizer (and in
	  Hospital/film_digitizer) from Bill Chimiak

BUGS FIXED:

	o New cascaded menu for the Fig object libraries.  This reduces the
	  height of the menu to allow many more libraries, by arranging them
	  hierarchically.  This required writing a subclass of the SmeBSB Athena
	  widget.
	o When browsing libraries or merging figures, identical user colors were
	  multiply defined
	o Fig library objects may use imported images because the absolute path
	  is forced in those cases
	o When modifying an existing centered or right-justified text, pressing
	  enter moved the cursor to the X position of the beginning of the
	  string just modified instead of its anchor point
	o "Delete Unused" button sensitivity not reset when loading subsequent
	  Fig files
	o If -library_dir (Fig.library_dir resource) pointed to a *file* of Fig
	  library directories, sub-directories weren't added to library list
	o If a bad Fig file was previewed in a library, xfig would display a bad
	  preview and segfault of the object was selected
	o Incorrect dx/dy distance reported when moving object/point
	o Better support for Cygwin - Importing eps files changes to the
	  directory of the file to avoid pathname differences between Windows
	  and Unix/Linux/etc
	  From Pierre Humblet
	o Can now rotate boxes and arcboxes by -90, -180 and 180 degrees in
	  addition to 90 degrees
	o A compressed .fig file is only uncompressed if the directory is
	  writable
	o When reading a Fig file, if there was a bad object inside a compound,
	  xfig would discard the entire compound.
	o When reading a Fig file, if there was an incomplete or bad object,
	  the storage wasn't freed in some cases.
	o xfig would stop reading a Fig file as soon as it encountered a bad
	  object
	o xfig now uses its own my_strdup() so it will compile on those machines
	  that don't have strdup()
	o "Minitower" computer in Fig object library of computers had an illegal
	  Fig object
	o Typo in Doc/FORMAT3.2 file in the join style descriptions.  Round and
	  bevel values were reversed (correct values: Round = 1, Bevel = 2)
	  Also, fill pattern list was incomplete and incorrect, and arc subtypes
	  were switched.
	o When cancelling modification of text using text tool, refreshing of
	  original text wasn't done
	o Comments longer than 200 characters caused problems.  They may be
	  unlimited in length now.
	o Some functions inconsistently declared static/non-static
	o Wasn't allowing negative rotation angle in indicator panel
	o Typographical error in xfig.man - resources "canvasBackground" and
	  "canvasForeground" should be "canvasbackground" and "canvasforeground"
	  respectively (no uppercase letters)
	o Updating objects didn't refresh the updated object correctly if the
	  bounds changed
	o The lengths and lines drawn when "showlengths" is enabled has been
	  cleaned up to remove detritus left behind
	o There was a bug in sizing of imported EPS images.  They were too small
	  by the equivalent of one pixel in width and height.  Strangely, this
	  also affected the background color in some cases.
	o When merging or pasting a figure of opposite unit system (metric vs
	  imperial), xfig used the wrong scale factor.
	o If malloc fails when xfig tries to create a Fig object, the null
	  pointer was subsequently dereferenced
	o Objects at MAX_DEPTH (999) were sometimes unaccounted for, meaning
	  they wouldn't be refreshed in some cases.
	o Balloon delay value wasn't visible in  Global Settings panel
	o When updating depths in a compound, xfig didn't check for depths
	  exceeding the maximum depth (999)
	o Grid calculations didn't coerce types properly, resulting in strange
	  grid in negative canvas region
	o Empty lines in the ~/.xfigrc file were causing xfig to segfault
	o Updated fig-format.html to correctly reflect Doc/FORMAT3.2
	o If a region was deleted (middle mouse button) and undone, the
	  recovered objects were invisible except for their grab corners
	o If an object was selected from a library while it was still loading
	  and placed on the canvas after the library finished loading, xfig
	  would segfault
	o When pasting or merging objects, xfig would recompute colors of
	  already imported pictures in current figure even if merged/pasted
	  objects didn't contain any pictures
	o When scaling a compound containg text, text size may have exceeded
	  MIN_FONT_SIZE or MAX_FONT_SIZE limits
	o Font name list was freed when it shouldn't have been, when using
	  -noscalablefonts
	o Changing depth of an object in the edit panel didn't always update the
	  depth manager correctly
	o Actual message was missing from "Error during ..." export message
	o Undefined user color in Libraries/Knitting/Symbols/purl-dash.fig
	o Removed unused user colors in various Library symbols
	o Bug when merging or pasting figures with user-defined colors.
	o No more than 100 points are  displayed for polylines, polygons in
	  popup edit panel to prevent system meltdown.  This doesn't affect the
	  maximum number of points *allowed* in a polygon/polyline, only the
	  number displayed.
	o Quotes around definition of MKDIRHIER should not be there in Imakefile
	o Made all references to Xaw header files use #ifdef Xaw3d to include
	  3d header files
	o Added back requirement that fonts (except Zapf Dingbats and Symbol)
	  are iso8859 encoded
	o When editing a compound object containing text, and the canvas zoom
	  is != 1.0, the zoomed text size was used instead of the unzoomed
	o Printer choice menu now discards any empty or duplicate printers that
	  are in /etc/printcap
	o A more robust algorithm for finding the center of an arc given three
	  points on the radius is in place. The old algorithm gave up too often,
	  making some operations on arcs (e.g. rotate) fail.
	o Rounding error in zoom-to-fit-canvas produced bad centering of figure
	o Maximum number of printers increased to 1000 for lprng systems, and is
	  now checked for exceeding maximum
	o Export to PDF now disables page size, orientation, etc. since PDF is
	  meant to be imported into pdflatex or other processors
	o Fixed a bug introduced in 3.2.3b which made selecting objects
	  difficult at higher zooms
	o When editing a compound, if either the width or height was made 0,
	  divide by 0 would occur
	o Line lengths weren't erased after creating arc box (showlengths on)
	o Doesn't allow coincident consecutive points in objects or boxes with
	  zero dimensions (coincident corners).  Also, doesn't allow box or
	  arcbox with zero x- or y-dimension.
	o Line width indicator didn't always update on some systems
	o Temporary files weren't closed before deleting them in read_gif,
	  read_tif and read_ppm
	o Undoing the conversion of a spline<->line or line<->spline would crash
	o When loading a figure from the recent files list in the File menu, imported
	  pictures with relative paths would not load
	o Illegal box object removed from Libraries/Examples/lidar.fig
	o Typo on html docs - button 3 cancels constrained copy, not button 2
	o Keyboard accelerators mislabeled - <Shift-f> flips objects left/right,
	  unshifted <f> flips them up/down

-----------------------------
Patchlevel 3c  (Jul 26, 2000)

NEW FEATURES:
	o New export shortcut Shift-Alt-x or Shift-Meta-x to export using
	  current settings without popping up the panel
	o New print shortcut Shift-Alt-p or Shift-Meta-p to print using current
	  settings without popping up the panel

BUGS FIXED:
	o Added -m 644 to "install" directives in Imakefile to make updates
	  easier in future (no read-only files)
	o I18N text handling fixed (bug introduced in 3.2.3b)
	o If a filename with an absolute path was given when starting xfig, it
	  prepended the current path to the path given thus generating a path
	  that didn't exist.
	o "Film digitizer" in Fig object library of computers had an illegal
	  Fig object
	o Pixmap bits for sm_check_bits should be unsigned in w_util.c

----------------------------
Patchlevel 3b (Jul 19, 2000)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Object library now shows icons of all objects. The size of the icons
	  is selectable from 40 pixels to 120 via a pulldown menu and resource
	  (Fig.library_icon_size). The the old "list" view is also available.
	o When drawing an arc by specifying the center point, a circle is drawn
	  showing the radius of the arc as the user drags the mouse, then when
	  the first end point is clicked an arc is drawn as the mouse is dragged
	o Simplistic super/subscripting by typing Ctrl-^ for superscript and
	  Ctrl-_ for subscript.  It creates a new string in the proper size
	  and position for super- or subscripting.  May be nested.  Does NOT
	  work for centered or right-justified text.
	  from Ian Hutchinson with improvements by Brian V.
	  Smith
	o new Imakefile variable NEED_STRERROR to allow for systems that don't
	  have the sys_errlist[] error string array (this is already in fig2dev)
	o Additional JPEG file format (EXIF) added. These usually come from
	  digital cameras
	o New library of knitting symbols from Kate Hedstrom
	o New Cisco network devices in Libraries/Networks from Louis B. Moore
	o New 10/100 Ether network hub in Libraries/Networks from Dirko van
	  Schalkwyk
	o New libraries from Al Delgado for Chen's model of Entity Relations
	  (Libraries/ERD) and symbols for various widgets, e.g. buttons,
	  sliders, scrollbars, etc. (Libraries/GUI)

BUGS FIXED:
	o If the BSD symbol is defined but has no value, the "#if" condition
		#if ( !(defined(BSD) && (BSD >= 199306)) && ...
	o Importing 24-bit PCX files works now with the new PCX reader from
	  Russell Marks (public domain).
	o Importing PPM images with more than 256 colors failed because it was
	  first converted to 24-bit PCX, which xfig couldn't read before now.
	o Importing TIFF files (which is first converted to PPM them to PCX)
	  works now with new PCX reader to handle 24-bit images.
	o Bug where updating an arrowhead used the line thickness from the
	  current settings instead of the line being updated to set the
	  arrowhead thickness.
	o "=" instead of "==" in checking if picture type is XBM to allow
	  updating pen color from update button
	o xfig would stop reading objects from a file when it encountered one
	  bad object unless it had already read one or more good objects
	o If a polygon was created with ALL coincident points (i.e. zero width/
	  height, xfig would remove ALL points when reading the file and would
	  subsequently crash.  Objects with zero width/height are now removed
	  when reading the file.
	o If a box with fewer than four points or a polygon with fewer than
	  three points is read from a file, xfig removes it
	o Could still move point of object even if its depth was not active
	o References to "make" in Imakefile changed to "$(MAKE)"
	o When vertex number display was turned on, canvas wasn't refreshed to
	  show them
	o When the page border was turned off, the zero-crossing lines weren't
	  redrawn
	o User colors defined in the current session weren't saved with the
	  figure.
	o User could click on text in disabled layer when in text mode
	o Bug which allowed only 511 user colors instead of 512
	o Background color of RGB slider lock buttons changed to random color
	  when lock turned off
	o User colors in current figure would be lost if user previewed more
	  than one file before cancelling file popup
	o "Transparent" color menu button for GIF export wasn't updated after
	  export panel was created when loading new figure
	o Spurious comments would appear in spline after editing control point
	o If editing spline point for curvature and spline line had zero
	  thickness, the spline would dissappear during edit
	o Incorrect declaration for put_msg()
	o Prepended $(DESTDIR) to $(XFIGLIBDIR) directory variable in Imakefile
	  to be portable
	o Changed w_menuentryP.h and w_menuentry.c to explicitely use
	  X11/Xaw3d/...  path for menu entry when user has XAW3D set in
	  Imakefile to use 3D Athena Widget set
	o xfig now uses gunzip instead of uncompress to uncompress .Z files to
	  be more portable for Cygwin environment
	o Current directory for loading/saving figures was overwritten when
	  changing export or picture browse directory
	o Loading a .fig file or importing a picture from an MSDOS filesystem
	  failed because xfig tried to see if the file existed with a suffix of
	  .Z, .gz, or .z, all of which were reported by stat() to exist because
	  it apparently truncates any suffixes after the first
	o Bounding box of objects in negative region weren't calculated
	  correctly when positioning grid was on
	o If "allow negative coordinates" was turned off, one could still pan
	  into negative region by dragging mouse on side ruler with middle
	  button pressed
	o Bug which prevented dragging rulers (with middle mouse button) into
	  negative region unless it had been moved into the positive region first
	o If user specified a -geometry on the command-line and then switched to
	  Portrait mode, the geometry requested was overridden
	o Various bugs in export commands when calling fig2dev
	o Inconsistent prototypes declared for pw_arcbox() and curve()
	o One of the header values for TIFF files was incorrect (was "DD",
	  should be "II")
	o When scaling a box and the point positioning grid is more coarse than
	  the points in the box, and you try to grab a corner of the box, xfig
	  thought you want to scale either horizontally or vertically only.
	o Excessive updating of layer buttons when reading Fig file fixed
	o Problem when exporting to GIF with transparent = background
	o Certain files are now opened in binary mode ("wb" or "rb") for DOS
	  compatibility
	o Rulers show units now every 10 units (e.g. 0cm, 10cm, ...)

----------------------------
Patchlevel 3a (Jan 19, 2000)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Library of UML objects (Unified Modelling Language)
	  From Andreas Ludwig

BUGS FIXED:
	o w_menuentry (subclassed menu entry widget) has been modified to be
	  compatible with the X11R5 Intrinsics besides R6
	o Several bugs in sprintf statements which create export command
	o Incorrect lengths reported when drawing box with "showlengths" on
	  and user scale != 1.0 (e.g. 1cm = 3km)
	o Declaration for preview_widget was both static and extern
	o Declaration for preview_pixmap was both static and extern
	o Two vars passed to XGetGeometry should have been int instead of
	  unsigned int (CreateCheckbutton() proc)
	o Added '#include "w_msgpanel.h"' for every file containing calls to
	  put_msg() or file_msg() since they contain varargs and should be
	  declared as having variable arguments

-----------------------
NOTE ABOUT GIF SUPPORT:

	Because Unisys has stated that they WILL charge royalties for the
	use of the LZW compression algorithm even in FREE programs, I have
	removed all traces of the GIF LZW compression/decompression code from
	xfig.  Xfig now calls giftopnm and ppmtopcx to import GIF files.
	Screen capture writes a PCX file.
	Exporting is handled by calling the ppmtogif program from fig2dev.

Patchlevel 3 (Jan 14, 2000)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Arrow thickness is a function of line width by default now instead of
	  absolute
	o If figure is modified and user does "File/New", xfig first asks if
	  user wants to save the file before doing the "new" operation
	o Changed the "paste text" key in app-defaults file from F20 to F12,
	  because most systems don't have an F20 key.  The "Paste" key on Sun
	  workstations (it is really F18) may also be used to paste text.
	o Changed default export border margin width to 0
	o Re-enabled export magnification for EPS
	o New "Flags" group of library objects from Roland Rosenfeld.  These are
	  flags of Europe which Roland converted from a Sketch example.
	  There is also Japan's and the U.S.'s flag which were drawn in xfig by
	  Brian Smith
	o Added Ian MacPhedran's web site http://duke.usask.ca/~macphed/soft/fig/
	  for FIG-related information to the html docs under "Related
	  Applications" in the "Getting and Installing Xfig" section
	o Moved allocation of xfig's 32 "standard" colors last in the widget
	  setup procedure so that there is a better chance of the widgets
	  getting the correct colors before the colormap fills up and xfig
	  changes to a private map.
	o Assumes default of Letter(or A4 if metric mode) if no %%BoundingBox in
	  imported eps
	o All traces of GIF decoding/encoding have removed from xfig so as to
	  avoid the patent royalty issue with Unisys corp.  xfig now calls
	  giftopnm (part of the netpbm package) to read the GIF file and then
	  ppmtopcx to convert it to a colormapped image that xfig's read_pcx
	  routine can handle.
	o New depth manager.  Enable/disable depths individually or all at once
	  to selectively hide parts of drawing.  Can also click on one depth
	  button and drag mouse up or down to enable/disable multiple buttons.
	  Command-line options -showdepthmanager and -hidedepthmanager to
	  control it (resource Fig.showdepthmanager). The default is to show it.
	o When updating the depth of a compound object, the relative depths of
	  the objects inside are retained, with the object having the smallest
	  depth number being assigned to the value updated by the user.  For
	  example, if you update a compound object to depth = 5, and it contains
	  objects with depths 8 and 11, after the update they will have depths
	  5 and 8 respectively. From T. Sato.
	o Default depth for creating new objects is now 50 to make it easier to
	  put new objects on top without having to remember to start the older
	  objects at a depth > 0.
	o Xfig allows panning to negative x and y now. This is the default
	  and may be turned and off with the -allow_neg command-line option
	  and from the global settings panel.
	o Command panel has pull-down menus for File, Edit, View and Help
	  operations.  Default accelerators for these menus are Meta-F, Meta-E,
	  Meta-V and Meta-H respectively.
	  File menu includes list of recently loaded Fig files.
	o Comments in Fig files are preserved with the objects and are written
	  back when the file is saved.  Popup edit for objects allows entering/
	  editing of comments.  Also, clicking mouse button 2 on the canvas in
	  edit mode will popup a panel to edit comments for whole figure.
	o From the File/Open panel, you may startup another xfig process to open
	  a Fig file.  From T. Sato.
	o New join/split button to split a line/spline/etc into two, or to join
	  two lines/splines etc together to make one.  Also, will convert a box
	  to a line by splitting between two corners, and close an open line
	  or spline by joining the two ends.
	o Arrow keys, Home and End keys may be used to browse any of the lists
	  in xfig. (e.g. Open file list, library popup object list, misspelled
	  word list in spell checker)
	o Border option put back in for exporting to EPS and bitmap formats
	  (fig2dev -b option).
	  User may specify border margin in pixels (roughly).  This will be
	  a background margin area around the figure bounding area.
	o New background color option for printing and exporting - sets whole
	  background of figure to this color.  Available for all bitmap formats
	  and PostScript, EPS, PSTEX and PDF
	o New background option to specify background color for figure.  This
	  works for all bitmap formats and PostScript (including pstex).
	  This is passed to fig2dev as the -g option.
	o If your system uses /etc/printcap to define printers, xfig will make
	  a pulldown menu for the printer selection in the printer panel.
	o New "smooth" button in export to smooth when exporting to bitmap
	  format (e.g. GIF, JPEG).  Causes fig2dev (using -S 2 option) to force
	  ghostscript to render at 2x magnification which improves font
	  rendering, then passes through pnmscale to reduce to original size,
	  which also smooths the image by averaging colors of adjacent pixels.
	o Export/Print errors now appear in the popup error message window
	o Popup object editor positions itself adjacent to object being edited
	  instead of possibly being on top of it
	o Xfig automatically chooses pwidth, pheight and the number of buttons
	  per row on the mode panel (left side) if necessary, to fit on a small
	  screen.  If the user explicitely chooses any of those options, their
	  choice overrides the automatic setting.
	o New PDF export driver (uses ps2pdf from the ghostscript distribution)
	o New CGM export driver (Computer Graphics Metafile) for fig2dev (and in
	  xfig export menu).  From Philippe Bekaert
	o More paper sizes (Japanese JIS B0-B10 and ISO A0-A9)
	o Middle button in paste mode will place object at its original position
	  (where it was when it was placed in the xfig cut file)
	o "Spinners" increment/decrement by value appropriate to item being
	  modified.  E.g., fill intensity % now steps by 5% for each click
	  of the mouse on the spinner arrows, and text step by 0.1.
	o Also, if mouse button is held down on spinup/down button, spinner
	  counts automatically after "spinner_delay" every "spinner_rate"
	  milliseconds (resources).
	o Fill intensity and Pattern fill now show image in popup edit panel
	o Can now draw arcs by defining:
		1. Center point
		2. First angle/Radius
		3. Second point to deterimine direction
		4. Final angle
	    Initiate this mode by starting arc with mouse button 2. Original
	    arc mode still available.  From T. Sato
	o New color scheme (grayish instead of bisque) - can still use old
	  colors by using Fig-color.bisque.ad or really old colors in
	  Fig-color.classic.ad
	o I have made the web pages available from our server at:
	      http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig
	  A mirror site in Japan is
	      http://www.lint.ne.jp/~masashi/xfig/index.html
	o Popup window with global settings (use Meta-g or Alt-g) containing:
		o checkbutton for tracking mouse in rulers
		o checkbutton for showing page borders
		o checkbutton for showing info balloons
		o checkbutton for lengths on lines
		o checkbutton for showing vertex numbers on objects
		o entry for max image colors
		o entry for image editor
		o entry for spelling checker
		o entry for HTML browser
		o entry for PDF viewer
		o checkbutton for turning on/off debug information
	     Consequently, the balloon on/off checkbutton has been removed from
	     the message window area
	o Two new "make" options:
	   1. "make install.doc" - install only the documentation files (i.e.
	      man pages, html and pdf files)
	   2. "make install.libs" - install only xfig object libraries
	o Filename mask for File and Export panels can have multiple wildcard
	  masks separated by blanks or tabs, e.g. "*.fig *.fig.gz *.fig.[Zz]"
	o Export wildcard mask is dynamically changed when selecting the export
	  language (e.g. *.gif when GIF is selected for export).  Thus, the
	  Fig*export_panel*mask*string resource is defunct.
	o New format for browser resource will parse for "%f" and replace with
	  the filename.  Using this and the -remote option for netscape, xfig
	  will either use a running netscape to open the help file (html) or
	  will start one if one isn't already running.
	o PDF viewer resource is also parsed for %f (filename)
	o Xfig will first try the correct PostScript font name (e.g. AvantGarde)
	  and then try a backup font name if the first fails.  If that one fails
	  too, it will use 6x13.  In the past, because the AvantGarde, Bookman,
	  HelveticaNarrow and Palatino fonts were NOT distributed with the X
	  distribution from the Open Group (and the X Consortium before that),
	  xfig would substitute fonts for those, that were close.  Now it will
	  try the correct one and switch to one of the backups if it doesn't
	  exist.
	o FIGAPPS file updated with new information about GNU plotutils
	o Rulers shows fewer ticks for smaller zooms
	o Rulers show more labels between major ticks for larger zooms
	o New floppy disk library object in "Computers"
	o New firewall symbol and "generic hardware" library objects in "Networks"
	  from Tomi Ollila
	o New "Optics" library includes mirrors, lenses, fiber optics
	  from Kai-Martin Knaak
	o New Structural Analysis library includes plates, supports, loads,
	  beams, coordinate systems and trusses.
	  From Roman Putanowicz
	  Please see copyright information in the Structural_Analysis/readme
	  object. (Libraries/Examples/Structural_Analysis/readme.fig
	o More descriptive error message about non-existent or old app-defaults
	  file
	o Removed restriction that fonts are ISO8859-1 encoded to allow, e.g.
	  iso646.1991, which is what the scalable Schumacher fonts are.
	o New computers/terminals in Computers library, and new network comp-
	  onents in the Networks library of objects.  From T. Sato
	o When a compound object containing right- or left-justified text is
	  flipped horizontally, the justification of those text objects is also
	  swapped (i.e. right-justified text becomes left-justified and vice
	  versa)
	o Warning printed if user uses Fig.geometry resource to size main xfig
	  window - should only use -geometry command-line argument or
	  pwidth/pheight args/resources.
	o Uses ANSI stdargs.h instead of varargs.h now
	  From Roland Rosenfeld
	o Spell check command uses "%f" now instead of "%s" for filename
	o Can define BINDIR to install xfig in custom directory (see README file)
	o Xfig windows aren't unmapped now when user presses "Edit Image" to
	  edit imported image file (not necessary)
	o When in edit mode and you hit Control-Return inside of a text box
	  rather than just Return, it's a shortcut for DONE.  From Jeff Hakner
	o When editing a compound object, any text objects in it are shown and
	  editable.  From Jeff Hakner
	o In library place mode, the change draw mode function was moved to
	  Shift-Middle rather than Shift-Left.  Shift-Left now has the behavior
	  of placing the object and doing an edit on it.  When you conclude the
	  edit, it resumes place mode.  This combined with including the text
	  objects in editing compound objects, allows you to edit any text
	  labels in library objects as they are placed.  From Jeff Hakner
	o Rotation angle of objects may be floating point now
	  From Marc Joosen
	o Spelling checker and search/replace popup more useful now
	o New "zoom to fit canvas" feature - Ctrl-Z accelerator in canavs will
	  zoom the figure to just fit the canvas.  New button in popup zoom
	  dialog to do same.
	o After closing an open compound, the "Open Compound" mode is selected
	o If the Shift key is held down while mouse button 2 is clicked on an
	  object, any comments in the object are displayed in a popup until the
	  mouse button is released
	o New command-line option -flipvisualhints (resource Fig.flipvisualhints)
	  which will flip left/right mouse indicator messages for mice whose
	  buttons have been switched.
	o New import picture formats supported - TIFF and PPM
	o Added -hiddentext and -rigidtext command-line options and X resources
	  to fill out the text flags options (first was -specialtext)

BUGS FIXED:
	o In "move point" mode, mouse button 3 incorrectly labelled as "Locate
	  Object", when in fact no function is associated with that button
	o Error reading GIF header under certain circumstances
	o For JPEG and GIF export, -g option was being passed to fig2dev even
	  with no background color selected
	o Exporting to PDF using xfig actually exported to PS.  Fig2dev does the
	  correct thing, though.
	o Depth manager didn't update correctly if depth between two other
	  depths was removed (e.g. when deleting an object of depth 51 leaving
	  only depths 50 and 52, the indicator for depth 51 wasn't removed from
	  the display)
	o PAPER_A4 pointed to A9 entry
	o Docmentation incorrectly mentioned "page_size" when it should say
	  "paper_size" (Doc/html/options.html)
	o Split line didn't work on ArcBox
	o Opening a compound object, changing an object inside, closing the
	  compound then pressing "Undo" would result in the original object
	  outside the compound, plus the changed object still inside, and would
	  then eventually segfault if the compound was operated on in any way.
	o Imakefile didn't install pdf files as advertised with "make install"
	o "XEvent event" missing from input tablet code in main.c
	o If xfig tried to import a compressed image file and the directory was
	  not writable, it segfaulted while trying to close an unopen file
	o Inadvertantly removed "Help/Xfig man pages" menu entry
	o Wrong path for installation of the xfig-howto.pdf file
	o Bad hyperlink for "Help Menu" in html docs
	o Fig files with "#FIG" but no version number crashed xfig
	o "Show depth manager" missing from screenshot and description of global
	  settings
	o Background color for exporting didn't have "None" option
	o PDF export ignored centering, background color and multiple pages
	  options
	o Warnings from fig2dev weren't displayed when exporting
	o Various command-line options missing from man pages and html docs
	o When turning on or off the depth manager the canvas needed refreshing
	o Symbol "MAXCOMLEN" defined by xfig is already used on some systems
	o Character array illegally freed in screen capture procedure
	o There is a less restrictive copyright on the html pages.  Instead of:
	    "However, you may not modify any part of this documentation
	    without explicit permission of T.Sato or Brian V. Smith."
	  there is now:
	    "Modification of this documentation is also granted as long as
	    this copyright notice remain intact and name of the person who made
	    the modification is explicitly written in the documentation.
	    However, contact to T.Sato and/or Brian V. Smith is strongly
	    recommended if you want to distribute modified version of this
	    documentation."
	o "Smart links" wasn't working when copying compound object with link -
	  the link wasn't copied
	o Preview figure wasn't freeing memory
	o Text lines with trailing carriage returns (^M) were read incorrectly
	  from .fig file, causing following object lines to be included with the
	  text object
	o Some calls to free_spline were passing wrong type of pointer
	  Fixed by Bradley Kuszmaul
	o Call to init_point_array shouldn't have arguments
	  Fixed by Bradley Kuszmaul
	o Changing to/from PostScript and LaTeX font type using the update
	  button didn't work unless "update text flags" was also enabled
	o The CompKeyDB file didn't get installed correctly if user specified
	  a path for DESTDIR (normally empty).
	o arrowhead thickness/width/height were being truncated to integers in
	  popup edit panel
	o was using /tmp instead of TMPDIR env variable for xfig cut file if
	  user .xfig file couldn't be used
	o cleaned up routines that "show line lengths" while drawing/moving
	  objects (-showlengths).  Much less detritus now.
	o bug when allocating more user colors than colortable can handle
	o message string not large enough for some of the balloons for the
	  attribute panel. From Martin Kroeker
	o Fixed bug in arc arrows introduced when units for arrowhead width and
	  height were changed to be the same as for arrowhead thickness
	o Pie-wedge arcs can no longer have arrowheads.
	o In the popup edit panel, if no numeric value was in either the fill
	  intensity or fill pattern entry and carriage return was pressed, an
	  illegal value might have appeared there
	o Filename sometimes trashed when trying to call external image editor
	  from edit popup on imported picture
	o If the text mode is selected followed by the "Paste" mode, xfig would
	  segfault
	o Another change to the "make install.doc" and "make install.libs"
	  because some systems' install program can only take one file at a time
	o "make install.doc" doesn't install the Japanese html files unless I18N
	  is set in the Imakefile (Internationalization)
	o If Fig.ad isn't installed, xfig died because "browser" or "pdfviewer"
	  resources were NULL
	o Mouse function indicator wasn't being reset for cancel library popup
	o Cancelling the library popup wasn't quite working
	o If preview of any library object failed, user couldn't place any more
	  library objects
	o Typing characters other than 'r', 'l', 'h' and 'v' are ignored when
	  placing library objects on canvas
	o When calling external image editor (via "edit image" from importing
	  picture object), argument list[0] wasn't name of image editor
	o When using the external image editor on an imported picture, xfig
	  compared the file modification time before and after to re-read it if
	  it changed, however the modification time before the edit was never
	  obtained
	o Moved JPEGINCDIR definition in the Imakefile near the #ifdef USEJPEG
	  for easier access
	o Bug in code which redisplays canvas sometimes left ghosts behind if a
	  "move object" was cancelled
	o Center/Flushleft setting was not properly set from figure file
	o Align-to-canvas assumed US Size A or ISO A4 paper instead of using the
	  current page size from export/print
	o Objects with large coordinates (e.g. 190000 Fig units) were drawn
	  incorrectly because of a peculiarity in either the X server or the
	  X Drawing procedures that didn't work correctly for screen coords >
	  16000.
	o If the canvas was either refreshed or zoomed while previewing a file,
	  things failed miserably
	o Line counter corrected when reading Fig file.  Was in error sometimes
	  when reporting bad input lines.
	o Fill patterns (e.g. bricks, vertical lines etc.) were not zoomed
	  correctly in figure preview
	o INLINE definition changed from "inline" to "__inline" to satisify DEC
	  Unix or Irix and Solaris OSs
	o Removed all "NullParameter" from Imakefile because OpenWindows doesn't
	  have it
	o Changed XPointer to XVisualInfo * in call to XFree in main.c for those
	  still running OpenWindows
	o The "About Xfig" window didn't trap for "Delete Window" so a window
	  manager that substitutes "Destroy Window" in that case would kill xfig
	o If user is previewing a figure (via popup file panel) and the canvas
	  needs to be redrawn it is deferred until the preview is finished,
	  preventing the Bad Window error previously seen.
	o Doesn't segfault now if no app-defaults file is installed
	o Bug fixed where a rotated string with only blanks (spaces) would
	  segfault
	o Mask for attribute panel button management changed to unsigned long to
	  insure 32-bit values
	o When reading in a figure containing an image, any offset in the file
	  panel was applied to the SIZE of the image.  This is obviously
	  incorrect.
	o When cancelling the file panel during a file preview xfig would
	  sometimes die with an X error.
	  Fix from Patrick Gosling
	o There was a bug when converting Fig 3.1 splines to 3.2 under certain
	  circumstances
	o Changed fig.h to always include (sys/param.h)
	o Various function mis-declarations and signed/unsigned casts fixed by
		Jonathan R. Ferro
	o Bug in image capture fixed by
		Jonathan R. Ferro
	o Not really a bug, but a change in default - define HAVE_NO_DIRENT
	  in the Imakefile if your system DOESN'T have dirent.h
	o When browsing pictures in the import picture interface, if you single-
	  click on a filename and then close the browse panel, it now applies
	  that picture.  In the past you had to double-click on a filename to
	  apply it.
	o Cleaned up error reporting of line numbers in Fig file
	o cur_dir[] array in mode.c wasn't large enough (changed to PATH_MAX)
	  From Martin Pahl
	o Hidden, Rigid and Special text flags weren't updated correctly with
	  update tool
	o -international and -inputStyle added to help message.
	o Multiple page option was being turned off but pulldown menu showed
	  otherwise
	o If the user changes directories in the file/open panel but then
	  presses "cancel", the original directory is restored now
	o Stops parsing library directories when limit is reached
	o Doc/FORMAT3.2 file (and all previous) incorrectly described the
	  bounding box for compound objects as having upper-right and lower-left
	  values, when in fact they have upper-*left* and lower-*right* bound
	  values
	o On a PseudoColor server, with xfig in -mono mode, it attempted to
	  store a color illegally
	o Editing of comments for picture objects wasn't retained
	o Library directory now may include files with more than just .fig in
	  name (e.g. .fig.gz, .fig.Z, etc).  Also, explicit check is made to
	  ensure that whatever matches *.fig* isn't a directory.
	o Missing quote for MKDIRHIER variable in Imakefile:
	  XCOMM MKDIRHIER = "/bin/sh /usr/bin/X11/mkdirhier"
	o When using small icons, xfig would still use 3 buttons per row on
	  small screens even when not necessary.
	o Allocation error in reading some pcx files
	o Bug in HSV color sliders when clicking left or right (increase/
	  descrease) mouse button
	o Bug in HSV color sliders on 16bpp PseudoColor visuals

---------------------------
Patchlevel 2 (July 2, 1998)

BUGS FIXED:
	o Placing a library object caused xfig to die after recursing for a
	  long time
	o Arrowheads in xfig 2.x files were incorrectly converted to 3.2.1
	  (they came out too large)
	o Imakefile didn't properly install Electrical/Physical and
	  Electrical/Schematic directories
	o Some variables multiply defined in u_draw.c
	o Some systems' "install" program don't have the "-d" (create directory)
	  option so I have reworked the install part of the Imakefile

---------------------------------
Patchlevel 1 Final (July 1, 1998)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Preview of figure is created when you single click on a filename
	  in the popup file panel. It also shows the size of the figure.
	o Library feature - load a library of Fig objects and pick and place
	  objects from the library on the canvas where you want.
	  See the man pages for details, and see Libraries/Examples for some
	  examples.  From Stephane Mancini
	  modifications by Brian V. Smith
	o Preview of library objects in library popup similar to figure preview
	  by Brian Smith
	o The library objects in the Electrical and Logic libraries were done
	  by Peter Hiscocks
	o Xfig tutorial (PDF) in Doc/xfig-howto.pdf.  Also available from the
	  Help menu. Written by Peter Hiscocks
	o "make install" installs the Fig object libraries to the library
	  directory.
	  The default is $XFIGLIBDIR/Libraries (/usr/lib/X11/xfig/Libraries),
	  which may be changed in the Imakefile.
	o When pasting a Fig object from the xfig cut buffer it appears under
	  the mouse (or near the mouse if pressing the "Paste" button) where
	  it may then be moved around on the canvas before pressing mouse
	  button 1 to place it.
	o Unit box in upper-right corner now shows the scale (e.g. 1cm=3km)
	  This necessitated making the top ruler a little narrower to make the
	  unitbox fit.  If the mode panel is on the right side, the side ruler
	  is made wider to fit the unit box above it.
	o The path of imported pictures is saved as relative path if picture is
	  in subdirectory of main figure file, else it is saved as absolute.
	  from T. Sato
	o When drawing a line, moving a point on a line, or adding a point to
	  the end of a line, the angle to horizontal is shown in the message
	  window
	o Pressing <Meta>-I turns on and off new feature that draws red
	  horizontal and vertical lines near the line you are drawing, or point
	  you are moving, to indicate rise and run.  Also, the length is shown
	  next to and above the horizontal and vertical line respectively, and
	  the actual length of the line is shown near the line itself.
	  The command-line argument -showlengths (resource Fig.showlengths) will
	  enable this feature as xfig starts.
	o Print popup button is active even when print panel is up which makes
	  it easy to force it to the top of the window stack if it is hidden
	o Pressing the File button in the command panel while the Export panel
	  is up will popdown the export panel and popup the file panel.  The
	  converse is also true - if the Export button is pressed while the file
	  panel is up, the file panel will be popped down and the export panel
	  is popped up.
	o When merging a file/figure into the current figure it is made into
	  a compound object first
	o Merging a figure keeps the file panel up to be able to merge more
	  figures
	o Better memory allocation for temporary arrays when drawing objects -
	  may be slightly faster now
	  from T. Sato
	o Freehand line/polygon drawing - use mouse button 2 to start after
	  choosing polyline.  As the mouse is moved points are added to the
	  line or polygon.
	  NOTE - this changes the line drawing behaviour:  Mouse button 3 is
	  now used to create a single-point object.
	o Whole window screen capture in addition to area capture in picture
	  object popup.  The behaviour of the mouse has changed with this -
	  Mouse button 1 captures whole window now and mouse button 2 is used
	  to capture area of screen.
	o Characters added to Fig*browse_panel*mask*string to include .tif
	  and .sld files
	o If xfig is started without a filename, the default filename is empty
	  instead of unnamed.fig.  This forces the file panel popup when save
	  is done, to enter a new file name.
	o Variable time delay for popup information balloons, specified in
	  milliseconds (-balloon_delay; resource Fig.balloon_delay)
	o If you enlarge the File, Export or Library panels only the file list
	  area is enlarged to show more files
	o New "spinner" widgets to increment/decrement values in popup indicator
	  entries (e.g. line thickness indicator popup)
	o Option of using either absolute values for arrowhead sizes or multiple
	  of current line length (see arrow size popup)
	o Arrowhead thickness, width and height can be set explicitely in
	  bottom panel for creating arrowheads.  Update button also copies
	  arrowhead size info to/from objects and indicator panel.
	  The arrowhead width and height parameters are now the same units as
	  the arrowhead thickness, which is units of line thickness, not 1/1200
	  inch as they were in previous versions of xfig.
	o Color popup menu in popup edit panel handles lots of colors better
	o Option of smaller icons for the mode panel (left side) by compiling
	  with USESMALLICONS in Imakefile.  See the Imakefile for details. Also
	  see Fig.ad.  Look for "icons".
	  From Andrew Morgan (morgan@physics.ucla.edu)
	o New grid and point positioning setting at 1/8" (or 2mm in metric mode)
	o When moving, copying, moving a point of or adding a point to objects,
	  all the "grab corners" of the other objects in the figure disappear
	  to make the figure less cluttered.  They reappear when the operation
	  is complete.
	o Pull-down menu buttons have an arrow icon to show that it is a pull-
	  down
	o Units such as "i" for inches and "c" for cm may be entered following
	  coordinates in popup edit panel for editing objects (e.g. 3c for 3 cm)
	  From Rick Richardson (rick@dgii.com)
	o When importing a picture file (eps, GIF, etc) xfig is more intelligent
	  and faster about deciding the format
	o "Integer area zoom" option in zoom popup - if checked, when using the
	  mouse to zoom an area of the canvas, the zoom amount will be an
	  integral value (e.g. 2, 3, 4)
	o Compose key LED may be turned on for multi-key characters (e.g.
	  a-umlaut etc) on Sun Sparcstations.  See README file about COMP_LED.
	  from Hans Werner Strube (strube@swing.physik3.gwdg.de)
	o New fig2dev driver for tk (tcl/tk) - Generates tk canvas and canvas
	  objects.  From Mike Markowski (mm@udel.edu)
	o Added "Alt" key definitions to the accelerators in Fig.ad to
	  accomodate those machines which don't have a Meta key

BUGS FIXED:
	o Line width is scaled with object scaling now
	o Arrowheads are scaled when scaling lines, splines and arcs now
	o Screen_res was incorrect for drawing tablets
	o When scaling a compound by using the "move point" edit mode, undoing
	  the scale didn't work properly because of rounding problems.
	  A proper "undo" is now performed.
	o Note: the -inverse (reverse video) option has been removed because
	  the same effect can be achieved using "-cbg black -cfg white"
	o Made the export_panel*mask*string same as browse_panel*mask*string
	o User-defined colors weren't being merged properly in compound objects
	o If Paste was performed while opening a compound object, some objects
	  outside the opened compound object may have been lost and xfig may
	  have crashed with a segfault later.
	o ARC-BOX corner radius scaled incorrectly when box was scaled
	o ARC-BOX corner radius is now only scaled with Scale operation, not
	  move point
	o Busy cursor wasn't being reset when reading some figures
	o Refreshing the screen while creating a Fig object (e.g. POLYLINE)
	  refreshes that object correctly now
	o Updated pointer for hp2xx and additional pointer to Fig related apps
	  in FIGAPPS file. From Ian MacPhedran
	o Declaration of clrtab array incorrect in f_neuclrtab.h - caused
	  problems on Digital Unix. From Ian MacPhedran
	o When loading a figure that changes the canvas orientation (Portrait/
	  Landscape), the file modified flag was not cleared
	o When it can't save to a file, xfig now rings the bell and puts the
	  error message in the *popup* message window
	o Trying to use the external image editor in the edit panel for an
	  imported picture failed if the file was compressed
	o When switching to a private colormap because of importing a picture,
	  xfig is better about matching the colormap of the popup edit panel
	o Objects not aligned correctly in large drawings due to bad choice
	  of starting min/max values (use INT_MIN and INT_MAX now)
	o When running "xfig -right" (mode/edit panel on right-side) the popup
	  balloons were too long, never showed the message and popped up and
	  down because they appeared under the mouse.
	o Cleanup of many, many function declarations (mostly type void)
	o Inadvertantly used incorrect font for Avant-Garde
	o When undo'ing load figure, any objects using user-defined colors may
	  not have been displayed correctly until doing a "Redraw".  Also,
	  non-existant user colors may have stayed in pen and/or fill color
	  indicators.
	o Bug in size of imported Picture when clicking on "Use orig size" -
	  image was slightly too small.  Also bug when clicking "Use orig size"
	  in metric mode - even worse scaling.
	o Code to check for bad font numbers when reading Fig file was in wrong
	  place
	o Bug in pcx decoder - odd-width images caused seg fault.  This would
	  also affect importing eps files since xfig uses pcx output from gs.
	o Another bug in pcx decoder - wasn't allocating correct amount of
	  memory for the image buffer.  This would of course, cause segfaults.
	o Bug in "Fit-to-page" in metric mode fixed
	  from Hans Werner Strube (strube@swing.physik3.gwdg.de)
	o Cleaned up mode button icons to fit within button area better
	o An old feature to prevent an expose event on the canvas from erasing
	  a newly imported image while still in the picture editor is no longer
	  needed and prevented screen refreshing
	o If screen capture is attempted with no Fig filename (e.g. when
	  starting xfig with no file name) seg fault occurred.
	  from T. Sato
	o Small correction to I18N draw_string routine
	  from T. Sato
	o Not all calls to fig2dev had I18N localization options passed
	  from T. Sato
	o If you create a new figure (no name yet) and try to export before
	  saving, xfig asked you if you wanted to save the figure first.  If
	  you said yes, it would popup the file panel to choose a name and save.
	  After that though, it wouldn't do the export as you first requested.
	  This has been fixed.
	o Added && !defined(__GLIBC__) to declarations of random and srandom for
	  systems with glibc
	o Imported eps files containing "initgraphics" commands weren't working
	  correctly.  This has been fixed by defining initgraphics and
	  initmatrix as {}.
	o Yet another #if added to the never-ending list.  This one is for
	  sys_errlist.  FreeBSD systems already define it in stdio.h.
	o Inconsistent declaration uncompress_file (static)
	o Missing braces around initializers for headers structure for imported
	  bitmap file types
	o Some unused variables and procedures removed
	o Incorrect casts in e_align.c
	o Bug in figure size in export and print panels - bounding variable
	  was clobbered soon after being calculated
	o Allowed saving over a read-only file if file panel wasn't created
	o Various problems with New figure->Export->File popup sequence either
	  segfaulting or permanently disabling xfig buttons and canvas fixed.
	o GC wasn't properly setup for dragging rectangle on screen for screen
	  capture for some systems.
	o Very small arcs "blew up" making very large arcs on screen
	o Bug in draw_arc() - would free unallocated memory if arc was small
	o Imakefile had w_icons.o in XFIGSRC instead of w_icons.c
	o Fixed annoying warning about StartScroll action not found on Linux
	  systems that use the "modified" Xaw3d widget set (ARROW_SCROLLBAR
	  defined, which makes the scrollbars look like the Windows scrollbars)
	o Mouse indicator was leaving bits of old text behind for long messages
	o Removed call to rint() because gcc can't find it on HP-UX
	o Move_point_selected() called set_mousefun() with too few args
	o Variable "text_translations" multiply defined
	o Fixed some bugs relating to updating dash-length/dot-gap in indicator
	  panel from dashed/dotted lines
	o Bug fixed where update indicator (red box) didn't always toggle
	  correctly
	o Undo of spline<->line conversion and box<->arc_box fixed
	o For some reason, the Solaris version of XtAppCreateShell references
	  an argument beyond what the users specifies in the command line,
	  causing a seg fault.
	  Fixed by Martin Pahl (pahl@tnt.uni-hannover.de)
	o Renamed suffix for AutoCad Slide export to ".sld" (was ".acad")
	o Needed #ifdef USE_JPEG in w_export.c for compiling without JPEG
	  support
	o Transparent color was not passed to fig2dev for GIF output (new -t
	  option in fig2dev do do this)
	o Inappropriate arguments to sqrt() in spline calculations (not double)
	o The radius value displayed in the message window was incorrect when
	  drawing ellipses
	o Both radii are reported now when drawing ellipses
	o Now checks whether Fig file is read-only before renaming to .bak and
	  allowing user to save. (after second save, original, read-only file
	  would be gone)
	o New #ifdef for glibc which has sys_errlist and random() defined
	o Conflict with definition M_PI (3.14159....) on RedHat systems fixed
	o Interpolated splines in Fig version 2.1 files were read incorrectly
	  fixed by Onno Roep (O.A.Roep@twi.tudelft.nl)
	o If you had a line with arrowhead(s) and deleted all the points to make
	  it a single point object, then undid the last delete point, the
	  arrowhead(s) didn't reappear.  This has been fixed.
	o Less multiple redrawing of figure when starting xfig with filename and
	  it needs to change orientation (portrait/landscape)
	o "Ledger" paper size removed from list of paper sizes.  It is really
	  "Tabloid" size in landscape mode.
	o Undo of align to canvas wasn't refreshing display

=============================================================================
Version 3.2 (first release Aug 22, 1997)
=============================================================================

GENERAL NOTE:
	Because Unisys Corp. has stated that they will not charge royalties for
	the use of the LZW compression algorithm in *FREE* programs, xfig will
	continue to support importing and exporting of GIF images.
	However, be aware that if you sell xfig, for example as part of a CD-ROM
	package with freeware, you may be liable for paying royalties to Unisys.
	You may comment out the USEGIF variable in the Imakefile to avoid this.
	With USEGIF commented out, xfig will still import GIF files, but not
	export in that format.  Also, for screen capture, xfig will create a PCX
	file instead of a GIF file.
	*** The authors of xfig and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
	cannot be held responsible in any case. ***

NOTE:	fig2dev now handles the exporting to bitmap formats (GIF, JPEG etc)
	  instead of xfig, so there is more consistent output. Requires the
	  netpbm package and ghostscript.  See the README file.

NEW FEATURES:
	o Japanese text objects (i18n) availble using flag I18N in Imakefile
	    from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o ppm, tiff (no compression) and AutoCad (acad) output languages added
	o Image quality (0-100) is selectable for JPEG export
	o Figure size (in inches or cm) is shown in the export and print panels,
	  taking into account current magnification
	o "Fit to page" button sets magnification so that figure size will just
	  fill current paper size with (at least) 1/2 inch margin all around
	o Emergency save file renamed from xfig.SAVE to SAVE.fig
	o When doing a screen capture for a picture object, the filename of
	  the capture is the name of the figure file + the time according
	  to time(3) + .gif, e.g. myfigure_858367466.gif
	o Xfig version number in app-defaults file is checked and warning
	    message appears if older than current version
	o Spell checker to find misspelled words in text objects
	    from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Search and replace - search for strings and either replace them with
	    new string or update settings like color, etc. on matched strings
	    from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Exporting to pstex does both PostScript and LaTeX part in one step
	    to file.pstex and file.pstex_t respectively
	o Popup messages (balloons):
	    o describes drawing/editing function when mouse passes over
	      any drawing/editing button
	    o describes how to activate unit/scale popup when mouse passes over
	      units box (where the rulers meet)
	    o describes mouse function indicator when mouse passes over it
	    o describes each command button in top row as mouse passes over
	      buttons
	    o toggle button labelled "Balloons" to turn on/off the balloon
	      messages
	   o all have configurable colors; see Fig-color.ad
	o New figures in Libraries/Examples directory from Bill Chimiak (chim@bgsm.edu):
		1. clp_computer1.fig - computer equipment clipart
		2. clp_hospit_equip.fig - hospital equipment clipart
		3. clp_network.fig - updated network equipment clipart
		4. musicnotes.fig - musical notes, scale lines and clef
	o Checks version number in app-default file with xfig version and warns
	   if file is older

BUGS FIXED:
	o Arrowheads on splines didn't always point correctly (fig2dev did the
	  right thing, though)
	o Accomodation for 15-bit visual (believe it or not!)
	o Checks bits-per-pixel for image formats because some vendors use 32 bits
	  for 24 bit depths
	o Minor difference in A0 and A1 page sizes
	o Changed XPM variables to default X include/library in Imakefile
	o Path added to save filename when xfig makes emergency save
	o Incorrect email address for xfig-bugs in man page (should be
	  xfig-bugs@epb1.lbl.gov)
	o Typo about font_flags bit number for LaTeX vs PostScript in
	  Doc/FORMAT3.2 file
	o Not enough space allocated for buf[] in create_print_panel()
	  and create_export_panel()
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Typo in Doc/FORMAT3.2 file about header information in Fig files
	o Typo in man pages - zooming uses only CONTROL key, changing spline
	  shape factor requires both CONTROL and SHIFT keys.
	o Justification and page size are now disabled with EPS export
	o Undo of converting spline to line caused seg fault
	o Added #ifdef USE_GIF around transparent color in export and read file
	o Error in sprintf format (was %4.2lf - should be %4.2f) in bottom
	  indicator panel buttons that have floats
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Center of pie-wedge style arc wasn't included in bounding box
	  from Andy Thomas (alt@picnic.demon.co.uk)
	o Better handling of mouse function indicator
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o If "edit spline point" panel is popped up before general edit panel,
	  'Warning: Action not found: apply' appeared when edit panel was
	  later opened
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Actions that had same names renamed to unique names
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Mouse button 1 and 3 didn't scroll the H, S, or V sliders in the color
	  edit panel
	o Unsigned/signed char pointer mix in create_pic_pixmap and
	  get_canvas_clipboard
	o Cleanup of dictionary wrapped around imported EPS files
	  from Franz Koch (franz.koch@zdv.uni-tuebingen.de)
	o Portrait/Landscape changes didn't properly toggle width/height
	o New font specified in app-defaults for those systems whose default
	  font was too large for popup panels (Fig*Font: 7x13bold)
	o Zooming not allowed if drawing object in progress (panning is OK)
	o strcasecmp and strncasecmp bugs (s2 != '\0' and s2 == '\0' should
	  be *s2 ...)
	o When exporting to bitmap format, bounding box of figure was rounded
	  to current point positioning grid (unintended)
	o Unaligned access errors on 64-bit machines (e.g. Alpha) when importing
	  bitmap pictures.  Now uses unsigned int for pointers
	o Code to remove identical consecutive points in line objects had bug
	o Workaround for long-time Intrinsics bug with scrolling text widget in
	  viewport for file and export lists provided by
	  Mark London (mrl@psfc.mit.edu)
	o Bug in control-key-button-1 zoom sequence - didn't allow control key
	  pressed when completing zoom operation
	o Mis-named fonts for zapf chancery and zapf dingbats (many servers don't
	  have these fonts anyway so please don't ask me where to get them)
	o Error in JPEGINC variable in Imakefile - had leading "/" in path
	o Width of "open compound" button was slightly too large such that
	  the mode panel (left) obscured part of the indicator panel (bottom)
	  when -but_per_row was 3
	o Transparent color for GIF export wasn't "None" as default
	o Box objects read in from Fig file would only have three points on
	  some machines
	o Grid wasn't changed to metric when loading metric figure
	o 24- and 32-bit export to JPEG was incorrect
	o "rotate and copy" for text placed first copy correctly, but subsequent
	  copies incorrectly
	o Comments after #FIG before end of header weren't parsed correctly
	o Landscape/Portrait is only available for PostScript export
	o Ledger/Tabloid sizes reversed (Tabloid is 11x17", Ledger is 17x11")
	o Deleting all objects (Meta-D) prevented the "New figure" function
	  by keeping the original figure name
	o Arrowheads were inadvertantly allowed for closed splines via the popup
	  edit panel
	o Picture objects rotated 90 or 270 degrees were also flipped
	o Changed sense of USEINLINE so default is NOT to use it

--------------------------
V3.2 Beta 1 (Jan, 9, 1997)
--------------------------

NEW EXAMPLE FILES (Examples/ directory)

    o fantastic figure from Robort Ford (rford@mailserv.mta.ca):
	transit.fig	- transit map of Saint John, New Brunswick (Canada)
			  Don't use it for locating transit routes - it is only
			  good through July 1996 and only shows non-rush-hour
			  routes
    o great figures from Carlo Kopp (carlo@cs.monash.edu.au):
	greenpig.fig	- F/RF-111C/G Tactical Fighter
	rfxc.fig	- RFX Strike/Recon Fighter
	lidar.fig	- Sidelooking battlefield surveillance LIDAR
	sowpig.fig	- RAAF F-111C fighter jet w/ 2x AGM-142 Have Nap SOWs
    o some nice figures from Peter Hiscocks (phiscock@ee.ryerson.ca)
	aircraft.fig	- light aircraft
	ps-foil.fig	- power supply circuit board foil layout
	ps-schematic.fig - power supply circuit board schematic
    o from Philipp Reisner (Austria).
	Linuxlogo.fig	- the only entry in the Linux 2.0 Logo contest to be
			  rendered with xfig - Unfortunately, it didn't win :-(
    o new clip art objects from W. Chimiak (chim@tachyon.medeng.wfu.edu):
	clp_computer.fig - various computers, monitors etc.
	clp_network.fig	- computer network components
    o more new example files (done by me, Brian Smith)
	3dhouse.fig	- cutaway view of a simple house drawn in 3D
	ctrlbox_lay.fig	- dimensioned drawing of a control box for a project in my group
	ctrlbox_sch.fig	- electrical schematic of the control box

NEW FEATURES

o better error reporting from ghostscript when importing EPS files
o in color popop panel, "lookup color" button allows user to grab color from
	any window for user-defined color in xfig
	uses code from xpaint (Copyright 1993 David Koblas (koblas@netcom.com)
	and Copyright 1995, 1996 Torsten Martinsen (bullestock@dk-online.dk))
o There is a new mathematical model for splines. The new version uses X-splines
	which allows to mix interpolation and approximation points in a same
	curve. More precisely, it means that an X-spline curve is neither an
	interpolated spline nor an approximated one, it is BOTH (the behaviour
	of each point is controlled by one single parameter called "shape
	factor"). For additional information about X-splines, see:

	  "X-Splines: A Spline Model Designed for the End User"
	  by C. Blanc and C. Schlick, Proceedings of SIGGRAPH'95

  o the shape factor of each individual point can be modified interactively
    with a dialog box that is displayed when pressing the right button in
    the EDIT OBJECT mode.
  o the shape factor can also be modified in any of the EDIT modes, by
    holding down the CONTROL key while pressing the mouse buttons.
  o because the CONTROL modifier is used for the shape factor edition,
    the zoom rectangle is now obtained by pressing the SHIFT key AND the
    CONTROL key while dragging the rectangle.
  o new features have been added in the CONVERT mode. Any conversion between
    polylines, polygons, open splines and closed splines are now possible.

    *** Caveat: Because spline models of previous versions (quadratic B-splines
    and Bezier with hidden points) are no longer supported, curves that are
    present in version 3.1 and older files are automatically converted to
    X-splines. This translation is only an approximation process. It means
    that the converted curves are not exactly the same as the original ones.
    Though the translation usually provides almost identical curves, some
    hand-fitting may be needed in some pathological cases.

    The new spline features were written by Carole Blanc (blanc@labri.u-bordeaux.fr)
    and Christophe Schlick (schlick@labri.u-bordeaux.fr) starting from an initial
    implementation done by C. Feuille, S. Grosbois, L. Maziere and L. Minihot as
    a student practice (Universite Bordeaux, France).

o the file format (protocol) has changed (see Doc/FORMAT3.2 for details). This
	means you must also get transfig 3.2. Xfig will still read older Fig
	format files but will always write the new format.
o multiple page flag, paper size, transparent color (GIF export) and print/
	export magnification now stored in Fig file (new protocol format 3.2)
o export/print magnification now command-line argument (-magnification) and
	resource (Fig.Magnification)
o paper size now command-line argument (-paper_size) and resource
	(Fig.paper_size)
o multiple page flag now command-line argument (-multiple) and resource
	(Fig.Multiple) (-single is default)
o option of transparent color for GIF export (e.g. make background transparent)
o new colors in Fig-color.ad resource file from Joel D. Young
	(jdyoung@afit.af.mil).  If you want the old colors, copy Fig-color.old.ad
	to your app-defaults directory as "Fig-color".
o works with GrayScale, TrueColor, DirectColor, StaticColor and StaticGray
	visuals now.  Use "-visual <visualname>" command-line argument or
	"Fig.visual: <visualname>".  Also, "-depth <depth>" (Fig.depth: <depth>)
	supported.
	thanks to help from Kevin Russell (krussell@dres.dnd.ca)
o "Delete All" button changed to "New" function - all objects are delete and
	the current filename is cleared.  Also, the file save and load shortcuts
	will force the file panel to popup if the current filename is empty.
	This will prevent a user from doing a "delete all" to create a new
	figure and forgetting to change the filename when saving.
o new edit features when entering text on canvas:
	Left arrow key and Control-B moves cursor left
	Right arrow key and Control-F moves cursor right
	Home key and Control-A moves cursor to beginning of text
	End key and Control-E moves cursor to the end of text
	Delete key and Control-D delete the character to the right of the cursor
	Control-K deletes from the cursor to the end of the text
	Pan operations using the arrows and the Home key are disabled during
	text entry because they are used for positioning the text cursor now.
o "Open Compound" operation to temporarily go inside a compound object to edit
	individual components.  Can enter nested compounds. Close compound to
	group objects back into compound.
	Written by Bill Taylor (bill@mainstream.com)
o xfig will now automatically unzip/uncompress Fig files with .Z, .z or .gz
	suffixes automatically.  It does not recompress/zip them when saving,
	though.
o -zoom (resource Fig.zoom) option to start xfig at any zoom value
o -startposnmode (resource Fig.startposnmode) option to start xfig with point
	positioning mode specified. Values can be 0 ("any") to 4 (1 inch/20mm).
o size of blank area (margin) around figure when exporting to bitmap-style
	formats (e.g. GIF, XPM etc.) is settable in export window now
o when zooming larger, spacing of dots in grid lines stays constant
o button to hide/show hidden directories (names that begin with ".") in file
	popup menus
o paper size selectable for printing and when exporting to PS/EPS:
	"Letter", "Legal", "Ledger", "Tabloid", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "A0",
	"A1", "A2", "A3", "A4" and "B5"
o in the past if an ellipse was scaled such that the radii become equal it was
	"converted" to a circle.  This "feature" has been removed.
o point objects (POLYLINES with only one point) now have thickness, as they
	should.  Additionally, if the cap style is rounded, they will be filled
	circles
o when exporting figure containing picture objects, xfig warns if the export
	filename is the same as any of the picture files
o note explaining how metric units are defined in xfig in the Doc/FORMAT3.1 file
o when updating objects with update button, they were drawn twice - now they are
	only drawn once
o when deleting xfig window (WM_DELETE_WINDOW), popup confirmation gives user
	the option to save figure
o README file updated to give credit for Example figures not done by Brian Smith
o default suffix for hpgl (ibmgl) export changed to "hpl" for PC users

BUGS FIXED

o smart links didn't work when the box being moved had line thickness > 1
o -exportLanguage ignores case now (e.g. GIF == gif)
o identical consecutive points in lines and "normal" splines are removed as file
	is read into xfig
o some thick arrowheads still protruded into the object they touched (in fig2dev
	too) - fix from Tobias Ringstrom
o resource for compose key database file is keyFile, not ComposeKeyDB (Fig.ad)
o color of labels for color numbers/names in color panel contrast their color
o edit panel allowed > 100% fill for black and white fill
o additional check for bad Bounding Box in imported EPS file
o when flipping objects vertically or horizontally, overlapping objects weren't
	redrawn
o format error in sprintf for temp filename in screen capture (%d should be %ld)
o some versions of imake don't like null parameters in SpecialObjectRule in
	Imakefile - changed to "NullParameter"
o "modified" flag wasn't being set when changing spline<->line or box<->arcbox,
	thus one could quit without saving without xfig confirming
	from Matthias Braun (browny@ise.fhg.de)
o when figure is read in from file, any arrowheads with width, height or
	thickness of 0 are given default values (were causing SIGFPE errors)
o colormap must be saved before jpeg_finish_decompress or
	jpeg_destroy_decompress are called in read_JPEG_file()
o when fore/background colors different from black/white respectively, the fill
	colors for black and white fill were incorrect
o when merging figure with no picture objects into figure with picture objects
	colors were unnecessarily remapped
o "rubberbanding" of object being drawn would continue after object was
	completed.  Also, double clicking on a directory name would cause
	segmentation fault.
	fixed by Stefan Proels (proels@fmi.uni-passau.de)
o Imakefile had error - $(PCXBUG) was incorrectly passed to f_readjpc.c
	instead of f_readeps.c where it was needed
o If the directory path in a file popup was changed by typing into the path
	window but carriage return wasn't pressed, rescan showed the correct
	directory but the path wasn't correct so no files were accessible.
o Redefined $(XPMINCDIR) to $(XPMINC) because some compilers have trouble with
	header search path with empty "-I"
o string allocation errors in string widgets in popup edit panels
o no return code for successful screen capture which would result in failure
	randomly
o picture objects scaled (enlarged) correctly in metric mode so they print 1:1
o incorrect values for white colormap entry when writing jpeg file on
	monochrome display
o Some people have older X11 include files that don't have <unistd.h> included.
	fig.h explicitely includes that now for the SEEK_END identifier
o Not enough space for number strings in rulers (SEG fault)
o circle grab points moved even if no changes made in popup edit of circle or
	ellipse object
o after attempt to do a horiz/vert move point of a circle was disallowed,
	further move points were disabled until edit mode switched
o if both points of "circle-by-diameter" have same y value it thought that the
	edge is the center when you try to use "box scale"
o colormap from jpeg file was referenced after memory was freed
o #include <jpeglib.h> changed to #include "jpeglib.h" to ensure corrrect path
	used to find header file
o problems on Linux with gcc locating old jpeg library even when JPEBLIGDIR
	pointed to local version
o buf too short in set_mixed_names
o line2 too short in button struct
o file not closed after writing JPEG file
o pen color for picture objects disabled for all except XBM (bitmap) in popup
	edit
o confusion with -DNOSTRSTR, NOSTRSTR and HAVE_NO_STRSTR cleaned up. See README.
o possible error in rulers with sprintf %f called with integer expression
o cleaned up add/delete user defined colors - no requirement to click on
	colorcell after "Add Color" to set color sliders
o added condition in Imakefile that f_wrjpg.c depends on jconfig.h (jpeg library)
o changed #include <jpeglib.h> to #include "jpeglib.h" because of search rules
o Version 1.0 of Xaw3d used resources topShadow and bottomShadow for colors of
	those resources.  Version 1.1 uses topShadowPixel and bottomShadowPixel.
	I have included both names in the Fig.ad app-defaults file for
	compatibility.
o removed extraneous comma (,) in length and distance messages when
	drawing/moving objects
o cleaned up many type mismatch warnings for bitmap data
o bug in skip_comment() which prevented some machines from seeing the end of
	file, giving erroneous "Incorrect format" error
o typos in xfig.man in resources StartGridMode, StartPosnMode, StartLineWidth,
	StartFillStyle and StartTextStep (had lowercase 's')
o pcx file was closed twice
o if there is an error when writing screen capture to a file, the popup error
	message window shows the error
o Examples/logo.fig had squished logo eps file
