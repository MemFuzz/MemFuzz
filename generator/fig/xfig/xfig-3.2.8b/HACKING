Compiling from development sources
----------------------------------

To build from the development sources, the autoconf tools must be installed.
In the top source directory, do
  autoreconf -i
  # -i ... install missing files (depmod, install-sh, etc.)
  ./configure; make; make install

To update the documentation, do
  cd doc
  make documentation
This requires the programs fig2dev and htmldoc. make documentation re-creates
doc/html/images/xfig-title.png and rebuilds xfig_ref_en.pdf from the html pages.

Optionally, make check and, after installing, make install-check.
Only very rudimentary tests are provided, thus not much is gained
from running them. Some tests require that the linker understands the
"-allow-multiple-definition" option. This does not seem to be the
case for the standard linker of BSD-variants and Darwin.
Try "make check LDFLAGS=-fuse-ld=gold" or "-fuse-ld=lld" to use a linker
that understands this option and allows multiply defined symbols.

The version of the package is given in the file version.m4.
Edit the file to adapt the version string. If the sources are maintained
in a git-tree, with
  ./configure --enable-versioning
the script update-version_m4 is run and changes the version string to a
string given by git describe.
