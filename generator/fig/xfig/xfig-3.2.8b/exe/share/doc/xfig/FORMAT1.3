NOTE: THIS FILE FORMAT IS OBSOLETE.  THIS DOCUMENT IS ONLY PROVIDED
	FOR BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY AND INFORMATION.

The following is the format of fig output (fig 1.3).

The first line consists of four number:
	screen resolution (pixels/inch),
	screen origin (1 : upper rigth, 2 : upper left, 3 : lower left,
			4 : lower right),
	canvas width (pixels),
	canvas height (pixels)

The first integer of the rest of the lines represents the followings;

	ELLIPSE		1
	POLYLINE	2
	SPLINE		3	(quadratic spline)
	TEXT		4
	ARC		5
	BEGIN_COMPOUND	6
	END_COMPOUND	-BEGIN_COMPOUND

The detail of each object is:

ARC
	type (3 : circle by radius, 4 : circle by diameter, 5 : circular arc),
	line_style,
	thickness (pixels),
	dash_length (pixels),
	direction (0 : clockwise, 1 : counterclokwise),
	forward_arrow (0: off, 1: on),
	backward_arrow (0: off, 1: on),
	arrow_ht (pixels), arrow_wid (pixels),
	center.x, center.y,
	point[0].x, point[0].y, (the 1st point the user entered)
	point[1].x, point[1].y, (the 2nd point or the last for type 3 or 4)
	point[2].x, point[2].y  (the last point if type is 5)

BEGIN_COMPOUND
	upperright_corner.x, upperright_corner.y,
	lowerleft_corner.x, lowerleft_corner.y

ELLIPSE
	type (1 : defined by radiuses, 2 : defined by diameters),
	line_style,
	thickness (pixels),
	dash_length (pixels),
	direction (is always 1),
	center.x, center.y,
	radius.x, radius.y,
	start.x, start.y, (the 1st point the user entered)
	end.x, end.y

LINE
	type (6 : polyline, 7 : box, 8 : polygon),
	line_style,
	thickness (pixels),
	dash_length (pixels),
	forward_arrow (0: off, 1: on),
	backward_arrow (0: off, 1: on),
	arrow_ht (pixels), arrow_wid (pixels),
	x1, y1,
	x2, y2,
	  .
	  .
	xn, yn,	(this will be the same as the 1st point for type 7 or 8)
	9999, 9999

SPLINE (quadratic spline)
	type (10: open spline, 11: closed spline),
	line_style,
	thickness (pixels),
	dash_length (pixels),
	forward_arrow (0: off, 1: on),
	backward_arrow (0: off, 1: on),
	arrow_ht (pixels), arrow_wid (pixels),
	x1, y1,
	x2, y2,
	  .
	  .
	xn, yn,	(this will be the same as the 1st point for type 11)
	9999, 9999

TEXT
	font,  (not used)
	size,  (not used)
	style, (not used)
	height (pixels), length (pixels),
	lowerleft_corner.x (pixels), lowerleft_corner.y (pixels),
	string (end at newline, \n)

There are only three line styles defined

	SOLID_LINE	0
	DASH_LINE	1
	DOTTED_LINE	2 (not implement)
