# Suppress alerts for weak cryptographic algorithms. The PDF file
# format used to rely on various weak algorithms. It is no longer
# necessary to use them when creating encrypted PDF files, but qpdf
# must always retain support for those algorithms in order to be able
# to read older files. qpdf issues warnings to try to prevent users
# from creating new files with weak encryption algorithms.
