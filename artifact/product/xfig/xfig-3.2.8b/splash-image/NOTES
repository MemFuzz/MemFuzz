(NOTE: 2010/10/27 converted xfig_splash_logo.xpm to ...png because exporting produced a blank image)

1. Edit spl_bckgnd.fig as necessary
2. Export to XPM from xfig
3. Export to XBM from xfig
4. Use xv to reduce the colors if necessary (xv -ncols 60 is good)
   May have to save reduced colors as GIF then load that and save as XPM.
   4a. If the lines are too long, run it through "xpmtoppm spl_bckgnd.xpm | ppmtoxpm > spl.xpm"
5. Import spl_bckgnd.xpm into w_icons.c (look for spl_bckgnd) in
   between #ifdef USE_XPM and rename;
	static char *noname[] = {
	to
	char *spl_bckgnd_xpm[] = {

	(remove "static" and change noname to spl_bckgnd_xpm)
6. Import spl_bckgnd.xbm in w_icons.c just after the XPM version,
   renaming noname to spl_bckgnd_xbm
6. Import letters.xbm in w_icons.c, renaming noname_ to letters_
