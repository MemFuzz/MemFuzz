The directory Schematic/Classic contains the material that used to be in 
Schematic in previous versions of Xfig. Figures are now compounded to present
a single object. To align figures with grid it is necessary to set units as
follows: Edit --> Set units; select Imperial (fraction).

The directories Schematic/{Imperial,Metric} have been added. 
Imperial icons will align with grid if units are set to 
Imperial (fraction). Metric will do the same when units are set to Metric (cm).
