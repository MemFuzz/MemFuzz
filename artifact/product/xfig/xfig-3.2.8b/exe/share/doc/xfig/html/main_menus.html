<img src="images/snap-accel.png" align=right alt="[ Snap menu ]">
<H2><font color="blue"><A NAME="snap-menu">Snap Menu</A></font>
</H2>

The Snap operations are used to snap the next point clicked by the user to some
location on a selected object.  For example, after invoking the Endpoint snap
mode, the next point clicked by the user will be used to identify the nearest
object and then, if that object has some feature that can be reasonably
interpreted as an "endpoint" the input point will be translated to that
endpoint.  If the selected object has more than one endpoint, the one closest
the initial point will be used.
<p>
Snaps can be used either in drawing mode, as described above, or in edit mode.
You could, for example, move an ellipse such that one of its foci coincides
wiith the midpoint of a polyline segment:
<ol>
<li>Select "Move"
<li>Select "Focus" from the Snap pulldown.
<li>Select the ellipse at some point on it near the focus.
<li>Select "Midpoint" from the Snap pulldown.
<li>Select the polyline segment.
</ol>
<p>
The following is a list of the available snap modes.

<DL>

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Hold</b>
<dd>
Usually, the selected snap operation is automatically deselected immediiately
after the the next point is clicked.  This button suppresses that behaviour,
keeping the selected snap operation in effect until it is manually released
with the Release button, q.v.  The Hold capability allows, e.g., the connection
of a series of polyline vertices by another polyline.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Release</b>
<dd>
Releases a locked snap mode being retained by the Hold button, or cancels a
snap operation after it's been selected.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Endpoint</b>
<dd>Endpoint snap mode snaps the input point to some feature
of the selected object that may be interpreted as an endpoint.  The feature
selected depends on the type of object selected:

<p>
<dl>
<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Polylines (including boxes and polygons):
<dd>Snaps to the nearest vertex.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Ellipses (not including circles):
<dd>Snaps to the nearest endpoint.of any of the semi-axes.  (This is not
relevant to circles.)

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Text
<dd>Snaps to the nearest vertex of the bounding box.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Arcs
<dd>Snaps to the nearest of the three arc definition points.

</dl>

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Midpoint</b>
<dd>Midpoint snap mode snaps the input point to some feature
of the selected object that may be interpreted as a midpoint.  The feature
selected depends on the type of object selected:

<p>
<dl>
<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Polylines (including boxes and polygons):
<dd>Snaps to the midpoint of the nearest polyline segment.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Ellipses (including circles):
<dd>Snaps to the centerpoint.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Text
<dd>Snaps to the midpoint of the nearest side of the bounding box.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Arcs
<dd>Snaps to the arc centerpoint.

</dl>

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Nearest</b>
<dd>While a polyline is being drawn, this operation simply snaps to the nearest
point on the nearest object.  This works for target polyline, circle/ellipse,
text (the bounding box), and arc objects.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Focus</b>
<dd>Focus snap mode snaps the input point to some feature
of the selected object that may be interpreted as a focus.  The feature
selected depends on the type of object selected:

<p>
<dl>
<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Polylines (including boxes and polygons):
<dd>Snaps to the unweighted centroid of the vertices.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Ellipses (including circles):
<dd>Snaps to the nearest ellipse focus, or to the centerpoint of circles.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Text
<dd>Snaps to the centroid of the bounding box.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
Arcs
<dd>Snaps to the arc centerpoint.

</dl>

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Diameter</b> <dd>While a polyline is being drawn, this operation snaps to a
point such that the midpoint of the segment specified by that point and the
"current" point is at the centerpoint of the selected object.  This works for
all objects except splines.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Normal</b>
<dd>While a polyline is being drawn, this operation snaps to a point on the
selected object such that the segment from the "current" point to the object is
perpendicular to the object.  If there are multiple possible normal points
(like to the near and far sides of a circle), the snap is to the one closest to
where the user clicked.  This works for target polyline, circle/ellipse, text
(the bounding box), and arc objects.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Tangent</b>
<dd>While a polyline is being drawn, this operation snaps to a point on the
selected object such that the segment from the "current" point to the object is
tangent to the object.  If there are multiple possible tangent points
(like to the sides of a circle), the snap is to the one closest to
where the user clicked.  This works for target circle/ellipse  and arc objects.

<DT><img src="images/blueballdot.png" alt="-">
<b>Intersection</b>
<dd>Lets the user select a second object and snaps to the nearest intersection
of the two objects.  Works between all combinations of circles, ellipses,
polylines, and arcs except (yet) the case of two ellipses at different angles

or <B><A HREF="installation.html#gzip">gzip</A></B>
(files which have suffix <TT>.Z</TT>, <TT>.z</TT>, or <TT>.gz</TT>). Before
opening a compressed file, the file will be uncompressed by <B>uncompress</B>
or <B><A HREF="installation.html#gzip">gunzip</A></B>.
<br>
A newer version of <B>xfig</B> can always open <I>Fig</I> files created
by older version of <B>xfig</B>, but the reverse is not true. When opening
files of older format, <B>xfig</B> will notify the user in a popup message
panel and will convert the file to the current version. There is no way
to save a <b>Fig</b> file in an older version format.
<br>
<a name="new-xfig-process">In addition to the <b>Open</b> button</a>,
a button labeled <b>New xfig...</b>
allows the user to start another copy of <b>xfig</b> running on any file selected.
This is a completely separate Unix process, but the two programs may communicate
through the cut/paste feature.

<A NAME="merge"><I>Merge</I></A>

<DD>
Clicking this button will read the figure from the file specified by the
<I>Filename</I> field and merge it with the figure on the canvas.
<br>
As in <I>Open</I>, the figure will be shifted at the amounts specified
by <I>Figure Offset</I>.

<p>
<DT><img src="images/redball.png" align=bottom alt="-">
<I>Save</I>

<DD>
Clicking this button will save the figure to the file specified in the
<I>Filename</I> field if any, or the file name in <I>Current File</I>
otherwise.
<br>
When trying to save to an existing file other than <I>Current File</I>,
a popup panel will appear and the user will be asked if he wants to save
over that file.
<br>
Also, <I>Current File</I> is updated to reflect
the new file name.
<br>
Before saving the file, the original file (if any) will be automatically
renamed to the same name but with the suffix &quot;<TT>.bak</TT>&quot; to leave it as a
backup file.

<p>
The style manager lets you save and load groups of
<a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> (e.g. line color, thickness,
font size etc.) by name.  For example you may want a
thick, dashed, red line style often, so using the style manager
you could choose those attributes and
save and recall them in a style called &quot;thickred&quot;.
<p>
When adding styles, only the attributes which are
<a href="editing.html#update-control">selected for UPDATE</a>
will be saved.
<p>
Also, you may have &quot;families&quot; of styles.  For example a family called &quot;lines&quot; may have
a collection of named styles for lines (e.g. color, thickness etc.) and a family called &quot;fonts&quot; may
have a collection of named styles for fonts (e.g. font, size, color, etc.)
<p>
To use styles, when you popup the style manager (View/Manage Styles... or <tt>Control-Y</tt>),
<b>xfig</b> automatically goes into update mode.
For styles already defined, choose the style family in the upper list
and the style in that family from the lower list.  The update buttons will
automatically be turned on for those attributes affected by the style
and off for those not affected.  At this point, if you click on objects
on the canvas they will be updated with those attributes.  Creating new
objects will use those attribtes and the others shown in the attribute panel.
<p>
To create a new family, enter the name in the <b>Choice</b>
entry under <b>Family</b> and press the <b>Add</b> button.
<p>
Now select the attributes that you want to be
affected by your style (e.g. line color, thickness etc.) by turning on or off
the red buttons in the upper-right corner of the attribute buttons
(see <a href="editing.html#update">Update</a>), and setting the
value of the attribute.
Finally, enter the name of the style you want to create in the
<b>Choice</b> entry under <b>Style</b> and press the <b>Add</b> button.
<p>
There is a limit of 16 families and 30 styles in each.
