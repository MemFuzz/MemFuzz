Glue selected objects and make them a COMPOUND object.
<dd>
<p>
This is useful to <a href="#move">move</a>
or <a href="#copy">copy</a> some objects together at the same time.
It is also possible to scale part of a figure
by <a href="#scale">scaling</a> a COMPOUND object
after making part of the figure COMPOUND.
<p>
Clicking on an object with mouse button 1 (`tag object')
will tag the object.
Clicking one corner of a rectangular region
with mouse button 2 (`tag region')
and then clicking mouse button 2 (`final corner') again
at the opposite corner of the rectangular region
will tag all objects inside the region.
After tagging all objects to be glued into a COMPOUND object,
clicking mouse button 3 (`compound tagged') will
glue those objects and make them a COMPOUND object.
<p>
If an already tagged object is selected by mouse button 1
or mouse button 2, that object will be untagged.
If you want to remove all tags,
change the mode temporarily to any other mode (e.g. &quot;move object&quot;) except BREAK COMPOUND.
<p>
The COMPOUND object may be separated into component objects by
<a href="#break-compound">BREAK COMPOUND</a>.

<hr>

<dt><img src="images/break-compound-button.png" alt="">
  <a name="break-compound"></a>
Break a COMPOUND object into separate component objects.
<dd>
<p>
Clicking a COMPOUND object with mouse button 1 (`break compound')
will break the COMPOUND into separate component objects.
Clicking with mouse button 2 (`break and tag')
will also achieve the same effect,
but it will tag those component objects for re-gluing with
<a href="#glue-compound">GLUE COMPOUND</a> again.
<p>
If you want to edit component objects without breaking the COMPOUND object,
you may open the COMPOUND object temporarily
using <a href="#open-compound">OPEN COMPOUND</a>.

<hr>

<dt><img src="images/open-compound-button.png" alt="">
  <a name="open-compound"></a>
Open a compound object temporarily for editing the component objects.
<dd>
<p>
<p>
Clicking a COMPOUND object with mouse button 1 (`open compound')
will open the COMPOUND object,
and then the component objects may be edited.
All other objects which were not in the COMPOUND object
will become invisible temporarily,
but they will reappear after all COMPOUND objects are closed.
<p>
If mouse button 2 (`open, keep visible') is clicked on the COMPOUND,
the other objects not in the COMPOUND object will become shades of gray,
making it easy to align objects inside the compound with those outside.
<p>
A popup panel with two buttons to close the COMPOUND objects
(<i>Close This Compound</i> and <i>Close All Compounds</i>)
will appear when a COMPOUND object is opened,
and the open COMPOUND may be closed again using those buttons.
Clicking <i>Close This Compound</i> will close the COMPOUND object last opened,
and clicking <i>Close All Compounds</i> will close all nested, opened COMPOUND objects.
<p>
If you want to break a COMPOUND object into component objects,
use <a href="#break-compound">BREAK COMPOUND</a>.
<p>
If the File/Save is attempted while a compound is open, <b>xfig</b>
will ask if you want to save only the open COMPOUND object (Save Part)
or the whole figure (Save All).
<p>
<img src="images/pict-info.png" alt="">
<i>Note</i>:
If you open a COMPOUND object,
<a href="#delete">delete</a> an object in that COMPOUND object,
close the COMPOUND object and
<a href="main_menus.html#undo">Undo</a> the delete operation,
the object you deleted will reappear but it will outside of the COMPOUND object.
Conversely, if you delete an object from the canvas,
open a compound then undo the delete of the original object,
it will now be part of the open compound.
In this way you may add or remove selected objects from a COMPOUND.

<hr>

<dt><img src="images/join-button.png" alt="">
  <a name="join"></a>
Join or split lines
<dd>
<p>
With this feature you may join lines or splines together or split
a line or spline into two objects.  Also, you may close an open line
(make it a polygon) or spline (closed spline) or open a box, polygon
or closed spline.
<p>
To join two lines or two splines together
click mouse button 1 (`Join lines/splines') to select the first endpoint
and again (`Choose next point') to select the second endpoint to be joined.
If the endpoints are on the same line or spline, it will make a closed object.
<p>
To split a line or spline into two separate objects or to convert a box
or polygon to a line, or to open a closed spline,
click mouse button 2 (`Spline line/spline')
between two the points on the line/spline etc.



<hr>

<dt><img src="images/chop-button.png" alt="">
  <a name="chop"></a>
Chopping objects.
<dd>
<p>
The Chop operation allows you to chop polylines, arcs, and circles into
individual objects that, together, approximate the original object.
(Ellipses will be supported in a future release.)
<p>
Left-clicking on one or more objects selects them as "axes".  When another
object is subsequently selected with a middle click, all possible intersections
between that object and all "axe" objects are computed.  These intersections
are then used to create a collection of new objects that approximate the
original.  Additional "axe" objects can be added at anytime, and any number of
objects may be chopped.  Right-clicking clears the axe list.
<p>
Circles will be partitioned into pie-wedge arcs and arcs will be partitioned
into either open or pie-wedge arcs, depending on the type of the original arc.
(In both cases, the type can be changed by editing the newly created objects.)
Open polylines and unconstrained polygons (i.e., closed polylines other than
boxes, arcboxes, and picture boxes) will be chopped into one or more objects of
the same type.  Constrained polygons cannot be chopped.
<p>
How polygons are chopped is controlled by the "Arc Type" mode in the indicator
panel.  If "Open" mode is selected, the polygons that result from the cut
operation will defined only by the vertices of the original polygon and the
intersection points; "Closed" mode will result in polygons that include, in
addition to the original vertices and intersects, the geometric centerpoint of
the  original polygon.
<p>
Chop operations cannot (yet) be undone.

use <a href="#edit">EDIT OBJECT</a> or <a href="#update">UPDATE</a>
and change the size of the text
(see <a href="attributes.html#text-size">TEXT SIZE</a>).
However, if a <a href="#glue-compound">COMPOUND</a>
object that includes TEXT objects is scaled,
the TEXT objects will also be scaled
if the <a href="attributes.html#text-flags"><i>Rigid</i> flag</a>
is not set.
<p>
You may use also <a href="#move-point">MOVE POINT</a>
if you want to scale an object such as a BOX
without keeping its horizontal/vertical ratio.

By setting <a href="attributes.html#smart-link">SMART-LINKS MODE</a>,
it is possible to copy the lines which touch the object
as you move the object itself.
This only works with POLYLINES (not splines) touching a BOX or ARC-BOX.
<p>
It is also possible to make many copies in this mode,
using <i>ARRAY PLACEMENT</i>.
To do this, first set the number of copies to be created
by setting <a href="attributes.html#num-x-copies">NUMBER OF X COPIES</a>
and <a href="attributes.html#num-y-copies">NUMBER OF Y COPIES</a>.
Then select the object to be copied by clicking the object

and specify the direction and distance to place the copies
by clicking mouse button 2 (`array placement') after moving the mouse.
Normally, objects will be placed on the array of
NUMBER OF X COPIES and NUMBER OF Y COPIES,
but when either of them is set 0 or 1,
copies of specified number will be generated
and they can be placed obliquely.  For example, if the number of X copies is 3 and
the number of Y copies is 0 or 1, the copied objects will be placed
along the X direction at the same Y position as the original object.
<p>
Clicking an object with mouse button 3 (`copy to cut buf')
will copy the object to the <i>xfig cut buffer</i>.
The object copied into the <i>xfig cut buffer</i> may be inserted

  <a name="select-object">Selecting Objects</a></h2>

Objects may be selected by clicking the <i>corner markers</i>
(<i>handles</i>) of the object.
The corner markers are small square marks
which are displayed at the corner point of objects
which may be selected for any particular mode.
<p>
Most objects may also be selected by clicking on the line
connecting corner markers,
but it may have a different meaning in some editing modes.
For example in the <a href="#scale">SCALE OBJECT</a> mode,
clicking on a corner marker will scale the object proportionally
to its horizontal/vertical ratio,
but clicking on a line connecting corner markers (edge of the rectangle)
will scale the object only in that direction (i.e. horizontally or vertically).
<p>
If <a href="attributes.html#point-position">POINT POSITION</a>
is set to other than <i>Any</i>,
objects which are not on the virtual grid may not be be selected.
<p>
When object corners or edges are coincident, clicking on the object
may not select the desired object but the other object instead.
In this case, the desired object may be selected with following operations:
<ol>
<li>Press (and hold) the SHIFT key and click on the object to be selected.
<li>If the corner marker of the other object is highlighted,
keep the SHIFT key down and click the object again.
<li>When corner marker of the desired object is highlighted,
release the SHIFT key and click the object again.
</ol>
Note that you shouldn't move the mouse during this operation.
