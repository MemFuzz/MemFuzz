<b>Xfig</b> was originally written by Supoj Sutanthavibul at the
University of Texas at Austin in 1985 for SunView.
Later, Ken Yap, at Rochester, New York, did the first port of <b>xfig</b> to X11.
In 1989, Brian V. Smith picked it up and added features such as multiple
fonts, line thickness, area fill etc.  Around 1991, Paul King
at the University of Queensland, Australia added many features and
overhauled the look
and feel of <b>xfig</b> for version 2.0, to produce essentially what you see today.
In 1992, Brian Boyter added the ability to import EPS files, and later it
was expanded to import several other bitmap formats as well.
Mr. Tom Sato from Japan added the
<a href="i18n.html">Japanese text support</a>
and the spell checker and search/replace feature in 1997.  He has added several
other features mentioned in the
<a href="new_features.html">New Features</a> section
and fixed several
<a href="bugs_fixed.html">Bugs</a>.
<p>
<a href="mailto://thomas.loimer@tuwien.ac.at">Thomas Loimer</a>
is the main contact for <b>xfig</b> and its incorporation of new
features written either by himself or others.
<p>
There have been dozens of people who have contributed to the success
(and code) of <b>xfig</b>,
and they are too numerous to mention here.  The man pages list some of those
people.  See below for the major copyrights.

<I>
Because Unisys has stated that they WILL charge royalties for the
use of the LZW compression algorithm even in FREE programs, I have
removed all traces of the GIF LZW compression/decompression code from
<b>xfig</b>.  <b>Xfig</b> now calls giftopnm and ppmtopcx to import GIF files.
Screen capture writes a PNG file.
Exporting is handled by calling the ppmtogif program from fig2dev.

Please send any questions, bug fixes, contributions and any comments to
following destinations.
When reporting a bug, please first check if the problem is mentioned in
the FAQ section of the HTML files (xfig Help menu).
<P>
If it is not mentioned there, be sure to report the operating system you
are using (e.g. SunOS 4.1.3), type of X server and version (OpenWindows 3, X11R6.4,
XFree86 3.2.2, etc) and color depth (e.g. 8bpp, 16bpp), and most
importantly the version of <b>xfig</b> or <b>fig2dev</b> that is having the problem.
<P>
It is also VERY useful to me if you can provide a stack trace from a debugger
such as gdb, dbx, ups, etc.
