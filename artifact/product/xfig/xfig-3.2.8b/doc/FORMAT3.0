The only difference from version 3.0 to version 3.1 is that the position
of the "magnet" has been shifted by 14 fig units.
In the 2.1 and older versions of xfig the grid was in multiples of 5 fig
units, but they were on intervals 4, 9, 14, 19, etc.
When version 3.0 was created, coordinates were simply multiplied by the
ratio of the resolutions (1200/80 = 15) so values like 4 became 60 instead
of 74 ((4+1)*15 - 1).

This means that figures converted from 2.1 and older files are offset by
14 fig units but new objects entered with version 3.0 are correct.

In version 3.1 the magnet grid is at intervals 0, 75, 150, etc instead of
-1, 74, 149, etc.
Figures from 2.1 and older are correctly converted now and a warning is popped
up when you read in a version 3.0 file that says you may have to offset the
figure when you load it, using the x and y offsets in the file panel.
