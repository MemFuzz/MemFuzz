A brief history of Fig translation programs.

Fig2dev is derived from f2p, the original program written by the author
of Fig, Supoj Sutanthavibul of the University of Texas at Austin, to
translate Fig code to PIC.  The development is somewhat complex.

Supoj adapted f2p for PostScript output: f2ps.

Micah Beck adapted f2p for PiCTeX output: fig2tex.

Frank Schmuck, then a graduate student at Cornell, adapted fig2tex for
LaTeX picture environment output: fig2latex.

Frank also enhanced Fig, giving us Fig-FS.  Micah in turn extended the
definition of Fig code and added corresponding features to Fig-FS.
Micah implemented this extension (TFX) in fig2tex, and in fig2ps, which
is an adaption of f2ps.

Conrad Kwok, then of the University of California at Davis, adapted
fig2tex for (E)EPIC output: fig2epic.

He also enhanced f2p to support the TFX extension: fig2pic.

Micah then reorganized the five programs named fig2* into drivers for
a single translation program: fig2dev.

In October 1992, Brian V. Smith has taken over the maintenance and
distribution of the TransFig package from Micah.

Until 2015, the software package was called transfig.

Since January 2015, Thomas Loimer maintains Fig2dev.
