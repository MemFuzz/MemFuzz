Fig2dev is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
which are portable, in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.

Fig2dev consists of the fig2dev and the transfig commands.  The fig2dev
command translates Fig code to other graphic description languages.  The
transfig command generates transfig.tex, a macro file for \input in a
TeX document, and a Makefile which translates Fig code to various
graphics description languages using the fig2dev program.  Currently,
transfig is considered obsolete, and it is not maintained any longer.
By default, transfig is not built.  To build transfig, enable it
explicitly with ./configure --enable-transfig.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

The transfig directory contains the source for the transfig command
which generates a Makefile which translates Fig code to various graphics
description languages using the fig2dev program.  In previous releases,
this command was implemented as a shell script.

The fig2dev directory contains a general program for translating from
Fig code to other graphics desciption languages.  The dev subdirectory
contains a library of output drivers used by fig2dev.

The man directory contains man pages for fig2dev and for the transfig
command. The doc directory contains a manual for using TransFig to
create documents with portable graphics.

Fig2dev and its companion xfig are available from
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcj


Runtime Requirements
********************

o To translate Fig to any bitmap format (GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, XPM, and others),
  first the Fig file is translated to PostScript and then ghostscript is called
  to render the image to the final format, or to PPM. The conversion from PPM to
  the final format is either done with an appropriate ppmtoXXX filter from the
  netpbm programs, or with convert from the ImageMagick package, or with gm
  convert from the GraphicsMagick package.

  o You need ghostscript, and

  o either the netpbm programs, or ImageMagick , or GraphicsMagick.

o To use the -a (binary) option for CGM export, the ralcgm program is
  required. This is available from ftp://ftp.cc.rl.ac.uk/pub/graphics/ralcgm/
